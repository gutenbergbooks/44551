    <p>"The rearing of larvæ, . . . when joined with the entomological collection, adds immense
    interest to Saturday afternoon rambles, and forms an admirable introduction to the study of
    physiology."</p>
    <p class="sp4 ar"><span class="sc">Herbert Spencer</span>, <i>in 'Education.'</i></p>
    <p>"When simple curiosity passes into the love of knowledge as such, and the gratification of
    the æsthetic sense of the beauty of completeness and accuracy seems more desirable than the easy
    indolence of ignorance; when the finding out of the causes of things becomes a source of joy,
    and he is counted happy who is successful in the search; common knowledge of Nature passes into
    what our forefathers called Natural History, from whence there is but a step to that which used
    to be termed Natural Philosophy, and now passes by the name of Physical Science."</p>
    <p class="sp4 ar"><span class="sc">Thomas Henry Huxley</span>, <i>in 'The Crayfish.'</i></p>
    <p>"It is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds,
    with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling
    through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different
    from each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by
    laws acting around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction;
    Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct
    action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse: a Ratio of Increase so high as to
    lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of
    Character and the Extinction of less-improved forms. Thus, from the war of Nature, from famine
    and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of
    the higher animals, directly follows. There is a grandeur in this view of life, with its several
    powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that,
    whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a
    beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved."</p>

  <p>The present work is intended as a guide to those who desire to collect or study our native
  <i>Lepidoptera</i>, and also as a book of reference to the general reader.</p>

  <p>In the Introduction I have first given an outline of the Transformations and Structure of the
  <i>Lepidoptera</i>. Then a brief sketch of the Darwinian theories respecting the origin of species
  and their special application to various phenomena exhibited by moths and butterflies, as well as
  a short outline of the general principles which have been followed in framing modern
  classifications of the order. Next follow five chapters on the various groups dealt with.</p>

  <p>With a few exceptions this work only treats of what are, for the sake of convenience, termed
  the <i>Macro-Lepidoptera</i>. A similar work on the numerous and interesting species of
  <i>Micro-Lepidoptera</i> found in New Zealand may at some future time be undertaken.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, I have to discharge the pleasurable duty of thanking the numerous entomologists
  who have so liberally assisted me in the production of this work. First, and especially, my thanks
  are due to Mr. Meyrick, without whose masterly papers and 'Handbook' but little could have been
  accomplished. Next, to Mr. R. W. Fereday, who very kindly allowed me to figure many species of
  which he alone possesses specimens&mdash;in itself an invaluable assistance. I have also to
  express my thanks to Messrs. E. F. Hawthorne, H. P. Hanify, R. I. Kingsley, A. Norris, A.
  Philpott, and others for the loan of specimens, and for much valuable information regarding the
  localities and habits of rare or local species. Lastly, I have to acknowledge the aid so willingly
  given by my lamented friend, the late Mr. A. S. Olliff, of Sydney.</p>

  <h1 class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="x-larger">INTRODUCTION.</span></h1>

  <p class="sp3">The order <i>Lepidoptera</i>, which includes all those insects commonly known as
  Moths and Butterflies, is chiefly distinguished by its members possessing four wings clothed with
  numerous minute scales, the term <i>Lepidoptera</i> being derived from the two Greek words, <span
  title="lepis" class="fsn">&lambda;&epsilon;&pi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>, a scale, and <span
  title="pteron" class="fsn">&pi;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu;</span>, a wing. The mouth of these
  insects is suctorial, the maxillæ forming a spiral proboscis which is coiled up between the large
  labial palpi when not in use (see Plate <a href="#plate1">I</a>., figs. 5 and 6). The other oral
  organs are rudimentary. To acquire this form these insects pass through three very distinct
  stages, viz., the Egg, the Larva, and the Pupa.</p>

  <h2 class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.7ex;"><span class="larger">I.&mdash;METAMORPHOSIS.</span></h2>

  <p class="ac">THE EGG.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The eggs of <i>Lepidoptera</i> are generally somewhat globular, much flattened
  above and beneath. Some are very elaborately sculptured, whilst others are quite smooth. They are
  usually white or yellowish, but always change much in colour as the contained embryo develops.</p>

  <p class="ac">THE LARVA.</p>

  <p>The larvæ of moths and butterflies are popularly known as caterpillars. They always consist of
  thirteen segments, segment number one being the head. The head is furnished with several simple
  eyes (Plate <a href="#plate1">I</a>., fig. 2, AA), a pair of very short antennæ (BB), and a very
  powerful masticatory mouth. The mouth consists of the following organs: The labrum, or upper lip
  (1); a pair of mandibles, or upper jaws, working like scissor-blades (2,2); two maxillæ, or lower
  jaws (3,3), each carrying a jointed organ termed the maxillary palpus; and the labium, or lower
  lip (4); which bears another pair of minute jointed appendages&mdash;the labial palpi.</p>

  <p>Segments 2, 3, and 4, which answer to the thorax of the perfect insect, are each furnished with
  a pair of legs. They consist of the six following joints (fig. 2): (<i>a</i>) coxa, (<i>b</i>)
  trochanter, (<i>c</i>) femur, (<i>d</i>) tibia, (<i>e</i>) tarsus, and (<i>f</i>) claw. These legs
  correspond to those of the perfect insect. The remaining nine segments of the body constitute the
  abdomen. Usually segments 7 to 9 and 13, each have a pair of fleshy pads, which are termed prolegs
  and are furnished on their edges with a row of minute hooklets (see Plate <a
  href="#plate1">I</a>., fig. 14, proleg highly magnified). It is these hooklets which enable
  caterpillars to hold on by means of their prolegs with such great tenacity. The number of the
  prolegs varies considerably in different groups and families.</p>

  <p>The <i>spiracles</i>, or orifices of the air-tubes, are situated on each side of the larva just
  above the legs. They are usually present on segments 2 and 5 to 12, but vary <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagex">{x}</span>considerably in different groups and families. The larva is provided with a
  very complete digestive system, which consists of the following organs (see Plate <a
  href="#plate1">I</a>., fig. 9): A, the &#x0153;sophagus; D, the ventriculus; F, the clavate
  intestine; E, the ilium; H, the colon; K, the biliary vessels; and O, the spinning vessels. These
  last open at a small orifice in the labium termed the spinneret (fig. 2, 5). They supply the
  silken threads which are employed by most larvæ in constructing their cocoons, and which also
  serve in cases of danger as a rapid means of retreat. Many larvæ, which live on shrubs and trees,
  suddenly lower themselves to the ground by means of one of these silken threads, and thus often
  escape being devoured by insectivorous animals.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The entire growth of the insect is accomplished during the larval condition, the
  increase in size being frequently very rapid. Owing to this circumstance larvæ are often compelled
  to shed their skin, and in many species a very considerable alteration both in the shape and
  colour takes place at each moult, or ecdysis as it is sometimes termed.</p>

  <p class="ac">THE PUPA.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The pupa of a Lepidopterous insect is completely encased in a chitinous envelope.
  With the exception of a slight twirling of the abdominal segments it is incapable of any motion.
  In the pupa of <i>Micropteryx</i> the mandibles and labial palpi are said to be functionally
  active, but this is a very exceptional though extremely interesting case. In conjunction with
  other evidence it would appear to indicate that the <i>Lepidoptera</i> originated from insects
  with active pupæ. The number of free or movable segments of pupæ varies considerably in different
  groups and genera, and by some modern authors it is regarded as a character of much importance in
  the framing of their classifications. The various organs of the perfect insect are distinctly
  marked out on the otherwise uniform integument of the pupa. In some groups, notably the
  <i>Micropterygina</i>, these organs are much more distinctly indicated than in others.</p>

  <h2 class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.7ex;"><span class="larger">II.&mdash;ANATOMY.</span></h2>

  <p class="ac">THE PERFECT INSECT OR IMAGO.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In common with all other members of the class, the body of a Lepidopterous insect
  consists of three main divisions: (1) the head, (2) the thorax, and (3) the abdomen.</p>

  <p class="ac">THE HEAD.</p>

  <p>The front of the head is termed the <i>face</i>, the top the <i>crown</i>, the sides are nearly
  entirely occupied by the compound eyes (Plate <a href="#plate1">I</a>., fig. 11, AA), and the
  lower surface by the organs of the mouth.</p>

  <p>The <i>Eyes</i> consist of a very large number of simple lenses arranged in the form of two
  hemispheres, one on each side of the head. The <i>ocelli</i>, or simple eyes, are situated on the
  crown, and are usually almost entirely covered by scales.</p>

  <p>The <i>Antennæ</i> are two jointed appendages attached to the top of the head above the eyes.
  They vary very much in structure. The following are the terms used in describing the different
  forms of antennæ in the <i>Lepidoptera</i><span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. <i>Pectinated</i>, when the joints have long processes like the teeth of a comb. If these
  are on one side only, the antennæ are <i>unipectinated</i>; if on both sides, <i>bipectinated</i>.
  (Plate <a href="#plate1">I</a>., fig. 20, bipectinated antenna of <i>Nyctemera annulata</i>.)</p>

  <p>2. <i>Dentate</i>, when the joints are armed with slight pointed spines.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexi">{xi}</span></div>

  <p>3. <i>Serrate</i>, when the joints have sharp projections like the teeth of a saw. (Fig. 18,
  antenna of <i>Melanchra composita</i>.)</p>

  <p>4. <i>Filiform</i>, when the whole antenna is simple or thread-like. (Fig. 19, antenna of
  <i>Epirranthis alectoraria</i>.)</p>

  <p>The clothing of the antennæ also varies, and is distinguished as under<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. <i>Ciliated</i>, when clothed with one or two series of short, fine hairs.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Fasciculate-ciliated</i>, when the hairs are collected into tufts. (Fig. 17, antenna of
  <i>Chloroclystis plinthina</i>.)</p>

  <p>3. <i>Pubescent</i>, when the antennæ are clothed with uniform short hairs. (Fig. 19.)</p>

  <p>The functions of the antennæ are still a matter of dispute amongst entomologists. The majority
  of the older naturalists regarded them as organs of hearing. The antennæ are almost always more
  fully developed in the male than in the female. From this circumstance many modern entomologists
  consider that one of their functions is to enable the former to find the latter.</p>

  <p>The organs of the mouth are thus distinguished:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. The <i>Labrum</i>, or upper lip (Plate <a href="#plate1">I</a>., fig. 11, <i>l</i>), a
  minute rudimentary plate situated in front immediately above the proboscis.</p>

  <p>2. The <i>Mandibles</i>, or upper jaws (m.m), two minute sickle-shaped organs situated just
  below the labrum, also rudimentary.</p>

  <p>3. The <i>Proboscis</i>, or <i>Haustellum</i><a id="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> (c),
  a tubular extensible organ formed of the two maxillæ, or lower jaws, which have become greatly
  elongated, semi-tubular, and closely pressed together at the edges, but separable at the will of
  the insect&mdash;a structure which enables the organ to be easily cleansed when necessary, and is
  extremely interesting as indicating so clearly the true development of the proboscis from the
  maxillæ.</p>

  <p>The <i>Maxillary palpi</i> (p.p) are two jointed organs attached to the base of the proboscis
  and very frequently rudimentary, but fully developed amongst certain of the
  <i>Micro-Lepidoptera</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The <i>Labium</i>, or lower lip, is situated below the proboscis and carries the
  <i>Labial palpi</i> (figs. 5 and 6), two large jointed organs which are very conspicuous in nearly
  all the species and often quite conceal the maxillary palpi. They are usually regarded as organs
  of touch, but their true function does not seem to be properly understood. In the
  <i>Lepidoptera</i> they appear to protect the proboscis, which, when out of use, is always coiled
  up in a spiral between them. The labrum and mandibles can only be seen by removing the large
  labial palpi.</p>

  <p class="ac">THE THORAX</p>

  <p>carries the organs of locomotion, which consist of two pairs of wings attached to its sides,
  and three pairs of legs attached beneath, a pair belonging to each of the three segments of which
  the thorax is composed. On the front of the thorax there are two flap-like organs covered with
  scales, termed the <i>patagia</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Wings</i> vary greatly in shape, but usually they are triangular. The portion of the
  wing which joins on to the thorax is termed the <i>base</i>. The front margin is called the
  <i>costa</i>, the outer margin the <i>termen</i>, and the lower margin the <i>dorsum</i>, these
  being described as situated when the wing is extended in flight. The angle between the costa and
  termen <span class="pagenum" id="pagexii">{xii}</span>is called the <i>apex</i>, and the angle
  between the termen and the dorsum the <i>tornus</i> (see Plate <a href="#plate1">I</a>., fig. 1).
  The termen and dorsum are edged with a fringe of hair-like scales, termed the <i>cilia</i>. At the
  base of the hind-wings is generally situated a stiff bristle, or several stiff hairs, called the
  <i>frenulum</i>, the ends of which pass through a chitinous process on the under side of the
  fore-wing near the dorsum. This process is termed the <i>retinaculum</i>, and serves, in
  conjunction with the frenulum, to lock the wings together during flight. In the female both these
  organs are often very imperfectly developed, the frenulum consisting of several bristly hairs, and
  the retinaculum of a group of stiff scales. In many of the <i>Lepidoptera</i> both frenulum and
  retinaculum are entirely wanting.</p>

  <p>"In the <i>Micropterygina</i>, a membranous or spine-like process called the <i>jugum</i> rises
  from the dorsum of the fore-wing near the base and passes under the hind-wing, which is thus held
  between the process and the overlapping portion of the fore-wing."&mdash;(Meyrick.)</p>

  <p>The veins of the wings are thus described by Mr. Meyrick<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"The wings are traversed by a system of <i>Veins</i>&mdash;tubular structures which serve at
  once as extensions of the tracheal system, and to form a stiff framework for the support of the
  wing. In the normal type of <i>Lepidoptera</i> the fore-wings possess three free veins towards the
  dorsum, termed 1<i>a</i>, 1<i>b</i>, and 1<i>c</i>; a central cell, out of which rise ten veins,
  numbered 2 to 11, the sides of the cell being known as the upper median, lower median, and
  transverse veins respectively; and a free subcostal vein, numbered 12; whilst the hind-wings
  differ from the fore-wings in having only six veins rising from the central cell, numbered 2 to 7,
  so that the free subcostal vein is numbered 8 (see Plate <a href="#plate1">I</a>., figs. 3 and 4,
  assumed type of neuration of a Lepidopterous insect). In some forms a forked parting-vein
  traverses the middle of the cell longitudinally, and a second parting-vein traverses the upper
  portion, so as to form a secondary cell; but these are more frequently absent or represented only
  by folds in the membrane. In a few forms there is a tendency to the production of several false
  veins, termed <i>pseudoneuria</i>, appearing as short branches from the subcostal vein of the
  hind-wings to the costa; these are thickenings of the membrane, and are commonly very irregular
  and variable, often uneven in thickness or incomplete. Sometimes one of these near the base is
  better developed and more permanent in character; it is then termed the <i>præcostal spur</i> (see
  Plate <a href="#plate1">I</a>., figs. 8<sup>9</sup> and 27<sup>9</sup>). Modifications in the
  general arrangement of the veins may arise through any of the following processes, viz.: (1)
  <i>obsolescence</i>, when a vein loses its normal tubular structure, becoming attenuated and
  reduced in substance, until it appears a mere fold of the membrane (Plate <a
  href="#plate2">II</a>., fig. 60, vein 5 in hind-wings of <i>Selidosema</i>); (2) <i>stalking</i>,
  when the two veins are fused together for a portion of their length from their base, so as to
  appear to rise on a common stalk (Plate <a href="#plate2">II</a>., fig. 34, veins 6 and 7 in
  hind-wing of <i>Hydriomena</i>); (3) <i>coincidence</i>, when two veins are fused together for the
  whole of their length, so that one appears entirely absent, an extreme form of stalking; (4)
  <i>anastomosis</i>, when two veins rise separate, meet, and are fused together for a certain
  distance, and then separate again (Plate <a href="#plate2">II</a>., fig. 23, veins 7 and 8 in the
  hind-wings of the &#x2640; of <i>Tatosoma</i>); (5) <i>concurrence</i>, when a vein rises
  separate, runs into another, and does not separate again, an extreme form of anastomosis; (6)
  <i>connection</i>, when two veins are connected by a short transverse bar passing from one to the
  other, a special form of anastomosis, evolved from the ordinary form under the influence of a
  tendency to lateral extension (Plate <a href="#plate2">II</a>., fig. 28, veins 7 and 8 in
  hind-wing of <i>Paradetis</i>). Vein 1<i>b</i> in both wings is often furcate at the base.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexiii">{xiii}</span></div>

  <p>"The type of veins in the <i>Micropterygina</i> differs from that described above in two
  essential particulars, viz.: (1) there may be three additional veins in the fore-wings, rising out
  of vein 11 or 12; and (2) the veins of the hind-wings are practically identical in number and
  structure with those of the fore-wings, being thus much more numerous than in the ordinary type.
  There is also often a system of cross-bars between the veins near the base of the wing (Plate <a
  href="#plate1">I</a>., figs. 22 and 23, neuration of <i>Hepialus</i>).</p>

  <p>"The structure of the veins can be best observed on the under surface of the wing, where they
  are more prominent. The student should begin by completely denuding of scales a few wings of
  common species: the wing should be cut off and laid on a moistened piece of glass, to which it
  will adhere; the scales should then be removed, first from one surface and then from the other,
  with a fine, moist camel's-hair brush&mdash;an operation requiring a little patience and delicacy
  of touch; the veins will thus be rendered conspicuous.<a id="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> When, however, the student has familiarised himself with the
  general subject, it will not be found necessary in practice to resort to this process; most
  details will be easily observed without denudation<a id="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>;
  where this is not the case (as where the veins are closely crowded or otherwise obscured), the
  scales can be removed with the brush on the under surface in the locality of the difficulty only,
  without cutting off the wing or otherwise damaging the specimen, which remains in the collection
  available for all purposes as before; with proper practice, even the smallest species are amenable
  to this treatment, which does not require more skill than the actual setting of the specimen. Some
  workers prefer to put a drop of benzine on the spot, which renders it temporarily transparent; the
  effect is short-lived, as the benzine evaporates rapidly, and the cilia (if long) are liable to be
  damaged by this method."</p>

  <p class="sp3">The <i>Legs</i> consist of the following joints (see Plate <a
  href="#plate1">I</a>., fig. 21): (1) <i>coxa</i>, (2) <i>trochanter</i>, (3) <i>femur</i>, (4)
  <i>tibia</i>, (5) <i>tarsus</i>, (6) <i>claw</i>. The tarsus normally consists of five joints, but
  is more or less aborted when the leg is not employed for walking. The spines (SS) on the tibiæ of
  the several legs vary considerably in size and number. They are often useful to the systematist
  for purposes of classification.</p>

  <p class="ac">THE ABDOMEN</p>

  <p class="sp3">consists of nine segments, some of which are often fused together. It contains the
  various internal organs, of which the most important are those of Digestion and Reproduction. The
  <i>Digestive System</i> (Plate <a href="#plate1">I</a>., fig. 10) consists of the following
  organs: A, the <i>&#x0153;sophagus</i>, or throat; C, the <i>sucking stomach</i>; D, the
  <i>ventriculus</i> or stomach; E, the <i>small intestine</i>; G, the <i>cæcum</i>; H, the
  <i>colon</i>; K, the <i>biliary vessels</i>; N, the <i>salivary vessels</i>. The function of the
  <i>sucking stomach</i> is to exhaust the air in the throat and proboscis, and thus to cause the
  ascent of the fluids into the stomach when the insect is feeding.</p>

  <h2 class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.7ex;"><span class="larger">III.&mdash;ORIGIN OF
  SPECIES.</span></h2>

  <p>The theory of the origin of species as propounded by Darwin may be thus very briefly
  summarised<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexiv">{xiv}</span></div>

  <p><span class="sc">Variation.</span>&mdash;No two organisms are exactly alike; there is always
  some variation from the parent form, in some cases very slight, in others considerable. (For
  examples of variation see Plate <a href="#plate7">VII</a>., figs. 1 to 9, varieties of
  <i>Hydriomena deltoidata</i>; Plate <a href="#plate8">VIII</a>., figs. 42 to 47, varieties of
  <i>Epirranthis alectoraria</i>; Plate <a href="#plate9">IX</a>., figs. 6 to 14, varieties of
  <i>Selidosema productata</i>; Plate <a href="#plate10">X</a>., figs. 13 to 23, varieties of
  <i>Azelina gallaria</i>; Plate <a href="#plate10">X</a>., figs. 39 to 47, varieties of <i>Declana
  floccosa</i>.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Inheritance.</span>&mdash;Many of these variations are inherited&mdash;a fact
  demonstrated by our domestic plants and animals, where man has selected and bred from varieties
  suitable for his purposes, and has thus produced races in which the variation is permanent. Many
  of the races of domestic animals differ as much from one another as do some distinct species of
  wild animals.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Struggle for Existence.</span>&mdash;All animals and plants produce far more
  offspring than can possibly survive, thus giving rise to the struggle for existence. For example:
  The average number of eggs laid by a Lepidopterous insect is certainly over 100, and in many
  species this number is greatly exceeded. Assuming each female to lay 100 eggs, the progeny from a
  single pair would amount, after six generations, to over six million individuals.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Natural Selection</span>, or the <span class="sc">Survival of the
  Fittest</span>.&mdash;In the struggle for existence which necessarily results from such a great
  increase of individuals, those variations which favoured the possessors would be preserved, whilst
  those which did not, would be gradually exterminated. This principle of the preservation of the
  favourable varieties in the struggle for life is called Natural Selection, or the Survival of the
  Fittest.</p>

  <p class="sp4"><span class="sc">Divergence of Character.</span>&mdash;As there are so many
  different places and conditions in the economy of nature which can be occupied by organic beings
  differently constituted, individuals which diverged most from the original type would be brought
  into less severe competition, than those which diverged only in a slight degree. For instance, if
  we represent the original form as A, occupying one place in the economy of nature; a second form
  as B, occupying a somewhat similar place; a third form as C, occupying a very different place to A
  although somewhat similar place to B, it is obvious that B would enter into severe competition
  with both A and C, whilst A and C might not trend to any great extent on one another's place in
  the natural economy; hence B would be exterminated before either A or C. In other words, natural
  selection continually tends to increase the slight differences, which we call varieties, into the
  greater differences, which we call species.</p>

  <p>The following phenomena, which have long been observed by students of the <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
  will serve as excellent examples of the operation of natural selection<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Protective Resemblance.</span>&mdash;This term is applied to those classes of
  form or colour which enable an animal to so closely resemble its surroundings as to escape the
  notice of its enemies. Numerous examples of protective resemblance exist in the New Zealand moths
  and butterflies; in fact, it may safely be asserted that nearly all the colouring we observe in
  these insects has been acquired for protective purposes. The following species, amongst many
  others which will be described hereafter, exhibit in a very marked degree the phenomenon of
  protective resemblance: <i>Epirranthis alectoraria</i>, <i>Selidosema dejectaria</i>, and
  <i>Drepanodes muriferata</i> resemble dead leaves; <i>Chloroclystis <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexv">{xv}</span>bilineolata</i>, <i>Tatosoma agrionata</i>, and <i>Erana graminosa</i>
  resemble, when at rest, patches of moss; <i>Selidosema productata</i> and <i>S. lupinata</i>
  resemble the bark of trees; <i>Chloroclystis lichenodes</i>, <i>Declana floccosa</i>, and <i>Elvia
  glaucata</i> resemble variously coloured lichens. It is almost unnecessary to point out that all
  those variations, which tended to conceal the possessors from their enemies, would be preserved in
  the struggle for existence, and that these numerous and perfect instances of protective
  resemblance would inevitably result from the operation of natural selection. The dark colouration
  of Alpine and Arctic <i>Lepidoptera</i>, which enables them to rapidly absorb heat during the
  short and fitful gleams of sunshine experienced on mountains or in high latitudes, is also an
  instance of adaptation to conditions through the influence of natural selection. This was first
  pointed out by Lord Walsingham in 1885. The almost complete absence of white species in these
  localities is a good example of the extinction of forms unfitted to their surroundings.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Contrast Colours.</span>&mdash;In this class of colouring the fore-wings only
  are protectively coloured, the hind-wings being very conspicuous. Contrast colouring is well
  exemplified by several of the insects included in the genus <i>Notoreas</i>. The sudden exhibition
  of the hind-wings during flight dazzles the eye of the pursuer. When the insect immediately
  afterwards closes its wings and the fore-wings alone are visible, it is extremely difficult to
  see. This form of protective colouring was also first drawn attention to by Lord Walsingham. (See
  page 75.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Warning Colours.</span>&mdash;Insects, which are unfit for food or nauseous,
  are not protectively coloured, but on the contrary are rendered as conspicuous as possible. This
  class of colouring is well illustrated by one of our commonest moths, <i>Nyctemera annulata</i>
  (Pl. IV., figs. 1 and 2). The principle of warning colours was first discovered by Mr. A. R.
  Wallace, and is graphically described in Professor Poulton's entertaining work, 'The Colours of
  Animals.' The possession of nauseous qualities would be of little value to an insect, unless it
  could be at once recognised by insectivorous animals and avoided as food. If a nauseous insect
  were not easily identified it would speedily be destroyed by what Professor Poulton ingeniously
  terms "experimental tasting"; hence, through the process of natural selection, all nauseous
  species have become very conspicuously coloured. It may be remarked that warning colours are
  extremely rare amongst the New Zealand species, and I am not aware of any other example than that
  already given.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mimicry.</span>&mdash;This term is applied to those remarkable cases where a
  harmless or edible species imitates in form and colouring a highly armed or nauseous species. No
  instances of this extremely interesting class of protection are yet known amongst the New Zealand
  <i>Lepidoptera</i>, but a very perfect example of mimicry exists between two common introduced
  species of <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>, the well-known honey-bee and the drone-fly. The
  superficial resemblance between these two insects is very close. The bee, as every one knows, is
  armed with a powerful sting, whilst the drone-fly is unarmed. In this case it can be seen that if
  a harmless insect varied in the direction of resembling a formidable or objectionable species it
  would be a decided advantage to it, and such varieties would tend to be continually preserved and
  improved, through the operation of natural selection. The subject of mimicry has been alluded to
  here as it is not impossible that some instances of it may yet be discovered in connection with
  our native <i>Lepidoptera</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexvi">{xvi}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3"><span class="sc">Ornamental Colouring.</span>&mdash;This class of colouring occurs
  in many species, especially amongst the butterflies, and is not apparently connected in any way
  with protection. Darwin supposes that it has arisen through the females of each species always
  selecting the most beautiful males as mates, hence these alone would leave progeny, and the
  females themselves would afterwards become beautiful through the effects of inheritance. This
  principle Darwin has termed Sexual Selection, and has discussed it in great detail in his work on
  the 'Descent of Man.' The fact, that amongst birds and butterflies the males are nearly always the
  most brilliantly coloured and the most beautiful, together with an immense mass of other evidence,
  tends, I think, to entirely support Darwin's theory, although it should be mentioned that several
  eminent naturalists, including Mr. Wallace, do not admit the principle of Sexual Selection.</p>

  <h2 class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.7ex;"><span class="larger">IV.&mdash;CLASSIFICATION.</span></h2>

  <p>From a further consideration of the foregoing principles it will be seen that all existing
  species are held to be descended by true generation from pre-existing species, and that,
  consequently, all the relationships we observe between species are explained by community of
  origin. The most natural system of classification is, therefore, that which best reveals the
  scheme of descent, or, as it is termed, the phylogeny, of the group of organisms classified. To
  construct a perfect system of classification on these principles a knowledge of not only all the
  existing species of <i>Lepidoptera</i> would be essential, but also of all the extinct species,
  and it is needless to say that such knowledge is quite unattainable. Nevertheless large numbers of
  species are now known from many parts of the world, and a very extensive collection has recently
  been employed by Mr. Meyrick in framing a classification of the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, which is, to
  the best of my belief, the first constructed on strictly Darwinian principles. Although adopting
  Mr. Meyrick's system in the present work I do not agree unreservedly with all his conclusions; but
  I have not attempted to alter his system in accordance with my own views, as I conceive that the
  conclusions of a naturalist, who has only had the opportunity of studying a restricted fauna,
  would necessarily be liable to considerable error.</p>

  <p>The general principles on which Mr. Meyrick has founded his system are practically those laid
  down by Darwin in his 'Origin of Species,' and may be thus summarised<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>A. Resemblances between all organisms are explained by community of origin, the amount of
  difference representing the amount of modification and expressible in the classification as
  varieties, species, genera, families, groups, orders, &amp;c. The amount of difference does not
  <i>necessarily</i> bear any direct relation to time, many forms remaining almost stationary whilst
  others are undergoing development.</p>

  <p>B. By a consideration of the following laws the age of a division can be approximately arrived
  at; that is to say, its position in the great genealogical tree of the <i>Lepidoptera</i> can be,
  to some extent, determined<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"(1) No new organ can be produced except as a modification of some previously existing
  structure.</p>

  <p>"(2) A lost organ cannot be regained.</p>

  <p>"(3) A rudimentary organ is rarely redeveloped."&mdash;(Meyrick.)</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexvii">{xvii}</span></div>

  <p>C. The greatest care is necessary to avoid being misled by adaptive characters, <i>i.e.</i>,
  characters which are very important to the welfare of the species, and hence much modified through
  the agency of natural selection. A familiar instance of superficial resemblance, due to the
  presence of similar adaptive characters, may be observed in fishes and whales, where two groups of
  animals with but little real relationship have, through living under similar conditions, become
  extremely like each other in external appearance. Other examples might be given amongst exotic
  <i>Lepidoptera</i>. Thus, many noxious species are closely mimicked by harmless forms which are
  often far removed from them in real affinity. These cases of adaptive resemblances abound amongst
  all organisms, and have often deceived experienced naturalists. It is in consequence of the
  illusive nature of these external resemblances amongst different members of the
  <i>Lepidoptera</i>, that the structure of the neuration of the wings is now considered of such
  great importance as a character for purposes of classification. The numerous modifications in the
  position of the veins and their presence or absence in certain groups can, so far as we are able
  to see, have had very little effect on the well-being of those insects possessing such
  modifications. Hence it may fairly be assumed, that these structures have been free from the
  influence of natural selection for a very lengthened period. It is thus contended that the
  neuration of a Lepidopterous insect probably reveals more plainly than any other character its
  true relationship with other species.</p>

  <p>The descent of all the <i>Lepidoptera</i> from some ancient member of the <i>Trichoptera</i>
  (or caddis-flies) is thus proved, according to Mr. Meyrick<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"From a consideration of the laws enunciated above, there can be no doubt that the
  <i>Micropterygina</i> are the ancestral group of the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, from which all others
  have descended; this is sufficiently proved by the existence of the four or more additional veins
  in the hind-wings of that group, for these veins, if not originally present, could not have been
  afterwards produced. Of the two families of that group, the <i>Micropterygidæ</i>, which possess
  an additional vein (or veins) in the fore-wings, and fully developed six-jointed maxillary palpi,
  must be more primitive than the <i>Hepialidæ</i>. Now if the neuration of the whole of the
  <i>Lepidoptera</i> is compared with that of all other insects, it will be found that in no
  instance is there any close resemblance, except in the case of the <i>Micropterygidæ</i>; but the
  neuration of these so closely approaches that of certain <i>Trichoptera</i> (caddis-flies) as to
  be practically identical. The conclusion is clear, that the <i>Lepidoptera</i> are descended from
  the <i>Trichoptera</i>, and that the <i>Micropterygidæ</i> are the true connecting link. If the
  other marked structural characters of the <i>Micropterygidæ</i> are taken into consideration,
  viz., the possession of the jugum, the large development of the maxillary palpi as compared with
  the labial, and the sometimes functionally active mandibles, they will be all found commonly in
  the <i>Trichoptera</i>, affording additional confirmation. It may be added that in one New Zealand
  species of <i>Micropterygidæ</i> (<i>Palæomicra chalcophanes</i>) vein <i>1b</i> is basally
  trifurcate, a character frequent in the <i>Trichoptera</i>, but not yet discovered in any other
  <i>Lepidopteron</i>. In most <i>Trichoptera</i> the veins of the hindwings are much more numerous
  than those of the fore-wings, in the <i>Micropterygina</i> they are usually equal in number, in
  other <i>Lepidoptera</i> they are less numerous; in the course of descent there has therefore been
  a greater progressive diminution in the number of veins of the hind-wings as compared with those
  of the fore-wings, though these also have diminished.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexviii">{xviii}</span></div>

  <p>"It is unnecessary to trace back the descent of the <i>Lepidoptera</i> further; but it may be
  worth while to point out that we may assume as the primitive type of Trichopterous neuration, a
  system of numerous longitudinal veins gradually diverging from the base, mostly furcate
  terminally, and connected by a series of irregularly placed cross-bars near base, and another
  series beyond middle."</p>

  <p>The following is Mr. Meyrick's method of arrangement, which has been adopted in this book<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"The natural order of arrangement, which is that of a much-branched tree, cannot be adequately
  expressed by a simple linear succession, such as is alone practicable in a book. It is, however,
  possible to devise a linear succession which shall be consistent with the natural genealogical
  order, if some additional explanation can be given. The method here adopted is as follows<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="ac w25 fcenter sp2">
    <a href="images/tree.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/tree.jpg"
    alt="Portion of the genealogical tree" title="Portion of the genealogical tree"/></a>
  </div>

  <p>"Suppose the accompanying diagram represents a portion of the genealogical tree; then the order
  will begin at M and descend to K, recommence at L and descend to K, and thence to G, recommence at
  H and descend to G, and thence to B, recommence at F and descend to D, recommence at E and descend
  to D and thence to B, recommence at C and descend to B and thence to A, and so on. Thus the order
  begins with the most recently developed forms and descends gradually to the earliest or most
  ancestral, which are the last in the book. To understand the order in practice, it may be assumed
  that each genus is descended from that which immediately follows it in the book, unless its actual
  descent is expressly stated otherwise; such statement will, of course, require to be made before
  every recommencement of a fresh branch. This system has been adhered to throughout, and after a
  little use will not be found unintelligible. If adopted in the arrangement of a collection in the
  cabinet, it would be a good plan to indicate the recommencement of a fresh branch by a special
  mark, such as a red bar drawn above the first (or highest) species."</p>

  DISTRIBUTION.</span></h2>

  <p>The details of geographical distribution are given under the headings of the respective
  species, so far as I have been able to ascertain them; but our knowledge in this direction is
  necessarily limited, and I have found much difficulty in obtaining reliable information, on
  account of the obstacles which exist in regard to the correct identification of species in other
  countries.</p>

  <p class="sp4">The distribution of the species within New Zealand is also very imperfectly known
  at present, owing to the paucity of collectors and observers, particularly in the extreme north of
  New Zealand, and on the west coast of the South Island. In the latter locality no doubt many
  interesting species remain to be discovered, especially amongst the mountain ranges.</p>

  <p>In employing the book for identifications, the reader is recommended to first refer to the
  Plates and see if he can find anything at all resembling the species he has, and then to refer to
  the description for verification. In dealing with variable forms, it is always well to remember
  that the <i>shape</i> of markings is generally far more constant than their intensity, or even
  their colour.</p>

  <p>The purely descriptive portions of the work have been made as brief as possible, and
  characters, of special importance for the identification of species, are printed in italics. Those
  who desire to consult more detailed descriptions may readily do so by referring to Mr. Meyrick's
  papers, in the Transactions of the New Zealand Institute and elsewhere. References to such papers
  are invariably given under the synonomy of each species which has been described by Mr.
  Meyrick.</p>

  <p>It should be mentioned that the figures and descriptions in this work have been prepared from
  nature, quite separately, and no attempt has been made to reconcile the figure with the
  description. This course has been followed so that any character, which may have been accidentally
  omitted from the figure, will not necessarily be wanting in the description.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The figures of neuration (Plates <a href="#plate1">I</a>. and <a
  href="#plate2">II</a>.) have all been made from fully denuded specimens examined under the
  microscope. They are in nearly every instance considerably enlarged. Each drawing has afterwards
  been compared with Mr. Meyrick's description, and if found to differ, a second examination of the
  wings has been made with a view to a reconciliation of results. Any important differences observed
  between Mr. Meyrick's descriptions and my final results are in every case specially mentioned.</p>

  <p>The <i>Caradrinina</i> may be distinguished by the following characters<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p>"The maxillary palpi are obsolete, the fore-wings have vein <i>1b</i> simple or hardly
    furcate, <i>1c</i> absent, and 5 approximated to 4 towards base. The hind-wings are furnished
    with a frenulum, vein <i>1c</i> is absent, and 8 is connected or anastomosing with cell." (See
    Plate <a href="#plate2">II</a>., figs. 1 to 12 and 14 to 18.)</p>
    <p>"Imago with the fore-wings more or less elongate-triangular, termen not very oblique;

    <p class="sp0">"Larva sometimes very hairy, usually with 10 prolegs, those on segments 7 and 8
    sometimes absent. (Plate <a href="#plate3">III</a>., figs. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15 and 16.) Pupa
    with segments 9 to 11 free; not protruded from cocoon in emergence."&mdash;(Meyrick.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>So far as New Zealand is concerned, the <i>Caradrinina</i> may be said to comprise that group
  of the Lepidoptera formerly known as the <i>Noctuina</i>, with the addition of the family
  <i>Arctiadæ</i>. Its members are chiefly nocturnal fliers; the body is usually stout, the
  forewings are narrow, and (except in the <i>Arctiadæ</i>) mostly dull-coloured, with three very
  characteristic spots. 1. The orbicular stigma, a round spot situated near the middle of the wing;
  2. The claviform stigma usually somewhat club-shaped and situated immediately below the orbicular;
  and 3. The reniform stigma, a kidney-shaped marking situated beyond the orbicular. The claviform
  is very frequently absent, and the orbicular less frequently so, but the reniform is an almost
  constant character throughout the entire group, with the exception of the <i>Arctiadæ</i>.</p>

  <p>There are three families of the <i>Caradrinina</i> represented in New Zealand, viz.<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p class="sp3 ac">1. <a href="#ARCTIADAE"><span class="sc">Arctiadæ</span></a>.<span class="gap"

  href="#PLUSIADAE"><span class="sc">Plusiadæ</span></a>.</p>

  <div id="ARCTIADAE"></div>

  <h2>Family 1.&mdash;<b>ARCTIADÆ.</b></h2>

  <p>The <i>Arctiadæ</i> may be characterised as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">"Eyes smooth. Tongue developed. Posterior tibiæ with all spurs present.
    Hind-wings with veins 6 and 7 connate or stalked (rarely approximated or coincident), 8
    anastomosing with cell nearly or quite from base to middle or beyond."&mdash;(Meyrick.) (See
    Plate <a href="#plate2">II</a>., figs. 1, 2, and 4, 5.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>This interesting family, although generally distributed throughout the world, is very poorly
  represented in New Zealand. Unlike most of the <i>Caradrinina</i>, many of the included species
  are day fliers and gaily coloured. One of these, <i>Nyctemera annulata</i>, is probably one of the
  most familiar of New Zealand insects, whilst the four remaining representatives of the family are
  but seldom seen. To British entomologists the name of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page2">{2}</span>"tiger moths" will probably at once recall several conspicuous and beautiful
  members of this family.</p>

  <p>This species is perhaps one of the best known of the New Zealand Lepidoptera, occurring in
  great profusion in all parts of both North and South Islands. It is also common at Stewart Island,
  in the neighbourhood of cultivation.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 1¾ inches. <i>All the wings are deep sooty
    black. The forewings have an irregular cream-coloured band running from beyond the middle of the
    costa towards the tornus.</i> This band is interrupted in the middle, and crossed by several
    black veins, which sometimes almost break it up into a chain of spots. The hind-wings have a
    single large cream-coloured spot near the middle. The body is black, with several orange
    markings on the thorax, and a series of broad orange rings on the abdomen.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This species varies a good deal in the extent of the cream-coloured markings.</p>

  <p>The larva feeds on the New Zealand groundsel (<i>Senecio bellidioides</i>), but in cultivated
  districts it is more often observed on <i>Senecio scandens</i>, a plant having a superficial
  resemblance to ivy, which frequently grows in great profusion on fences and hedgerows in various
  parts of the country.</p>

  <p>Mr. W. W. Smith informs us<a id="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> that it also feeds on
  the common groundsel (<i>S. vulgaris</i>) as well as on <i>Cineraria maritima</i>. I have often
  seen these caterpillars on mild days in the middle of winter, and full-grown specimens are very
  common towards the end of August, so that I think there is little doubt that the species passes
  the winter in the larval condition. At other seasons there is a continuous succession of
  broods.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The length of the caterpillar when full grown is 1½ inches. It is covered with
    numerous tufts of long black hair, and is black in colour, with the dorsal and lateral lines
    dark-red. There are several large blue spots round the middle of each of the segments, and the
    membrane between each segment is bluish-grey. In younger larvæ the bluish-grey colouring extends
    over a considerable portion of the insect.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This caterpillar may be readily found, as it feeds on the upper surface of the leaves fully
  exposed to view. Its hairy armour evidently renders it unpalatable to birds, and hence the secret
  habits we observe in most larvæ are absent in this species.</p>

  <p>When full-fed it selects a secluded spot, generally a crevice in the trunk of a tree, where it
  spins an oval cocoon of silk intermixed with its own hairs. Here it changes <span class="pagenum"
  id="page3">{3}</span>into a shining black pupa, speckled and striped with yellow. The insect
  remains in this state about six weeks.</p>

  <p>The moth first appears in September, and continues abundant until about the end of March. It is
  extremely common, especially during the latter end of summer, when specimens may often be seen
  flying in all directions. Mr. Meyrick observes<a id="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> that
  this species has the curious habit of soaring in the early morning sunshine, soon after sunrise,
  in calm, fine weather. He states that he has seen them in numbers, flying round the tops of trees,
  at a height of over 100 feet. I can fully corroborate the accuracy of this interesting
  observation, and have noticed the insect to be most active between the hours of five and eight on
  fine mornings in midsummer. The habit is certainly a very unusual one, as most insects are rarely
  seen at that time of the day.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This moth is confined to New Zealand, but two closely allied species, belonging to
  the same genus, are found in Australia.</p>

  <p>This species was first observed in New Zealand in February, 1887, when I captured a single
  specimen in the Wainui-o-mata valley. Since that time Mr. A. Norris has seen two others near
  Petone, one of which is now in his collection. All the specimens at present noticed have
  consequently occurred in a very restricted portion of the Wellington District, though it is
  probable that the insect is far more generally distributed throughout the country than these
  records would seem to indicate.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 1¼ inches. <i>The fore-wings are white, with
    five irregular transverse rows of oblong crimson spots, alternating with six irregular rows of
    small black dots.</i> The hind-wings are white, irregularly clouded with black on the termen;
    there are two small black spots near the middle. The body is white; the head and thorax are
    spotted with crimson, and the antennæ are black.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The larva is thus described by Newman:&mdash;<a id="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">"The ground colour is leaden with a covering of black hairs; there is a broad
    white stripe down the back, and on each segment down the side is a double scarlet spot. On the
    continent of Europe this caterpillar is said to feed on the forget-me-not (<i>Myosotis
    arvensis</i>)."</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">In New Zealand the moth appears in February. Mr. Meyrick remarks<a id="NtA_7"
  href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>:&mdash;"It is probably only an occasional immigrant. Although a
  feeble-looking insect, it possesses extraordinary capabilities of flight, and is sometimes met
  with far out at sea. It occurs throughout Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Pacific
  Islands." It is well known to <span class="pagenum" id="page4">{4}</span>English entomologists as
  a great rarity, and many discussions have taken place at various times as to the propriety of
  retaining it on the list of British Lepidoptera.</p>

  <p>This handsome species is at present only known by a single specimen, captured by Mr. W. W.
  Smith, near the summit of the Richardson Range, in South Canterbury, at an elevation of about
  3,000 feet.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings of the male is 1½ inches. <i>The fore-wings are black,
    with two broad, dull yellow, longitudinal streaks</i>; between the costa and the first streak is
    a very fine yellowish line, and between the two streaks there are three similar lines. <i>The
    hind-wings are bright yellow, with a broad black band, parallel to the termen, interrupted just
    before the tornus; the vicinity of this black band is tinged with crimson.</i> The body is
    black; the top of the head, collar, and sides of the thorax and abdomen are dull yellow. The
    female is probably apterous.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">This species may be readily distinguished from the two following by the yellow
  collar, absence of any large spot in the centre of both fore-wings and hind-wings, and the red
  colouring of the termen of the hind-wings. The moth was taken in February, frequenting a species
  of <i>Carmichælia</i>. It may be looked for in the mountainous regions of South Canterbury, but at
  present nothing further is known of its habits.</p>

  <p>This species was discovered by Mr. Meyrick on Mount Arthur in the Nelson District in 1886.
  Since that time I have taken eleven specimens in the same locality, and have seen several others,
  but as yet I have not heard of its occurrence elsewhere.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is 1½ inches. <i>The fore-wings are black, with
    orange-yellow markings.</i> These consist of a fine line near the costa, becoming very broad
    near the base, several elongate markings between the veins near the middle, a series of spots
    near the termen, and a broad streak parallel to the dorsum. The hind-wings are orange-yellow,
    with a curved black spot in the middle, and a broad black band on the termen, ending
    considerably before the tornus, and nearly broken a little before its termination. The female,
    according to Mr. Meyrick,<a id="NtA_8" href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> is "wholly
    whitish-ochreous; wings minute, aborted; legs short, stout, well developed."</p>

  is largely taken by the <i>Plusiadæ</i>. The structure is in most particulars remarkably uniform,
  the neuration and palpi being practically identical throughout the family. The markings are
  usually very similar, and the colouring dull and adapted to conceal insects which are accustomed
  to hide amongst dead leaves or refuse; hence this family is not one of the easiest or most
  attractive to study. The species are the most truly nocturnal of all the Lepidoptera; few are
  readily obtainable by day, but at night they are found in abundance at flowers or sugar. Imago
  with fore-wings usually elongate, body relatively stout, and densely scaled. It may be noted as an
  established conclusion that antennal pectinations, if not extending to the apex of the antennæ,
  are in this family seldom sufficient to mark generic distinction.</p>

  <p>"Ovum spherical, more or less distinctly ribbed, and reticulated. Larva usually with few hairs,
  often nocturnal, sometimes subterranean; often very polyphagous. Pupa usually
  subterranean."&mdash;(Meyrick.)</p>

  <p>The family is represented in New Zealand by the following twelve genera<span

  <p>This is apparently a common and generally distributed species. It has occurred plentifully at
  Wellington, Blenheim, Christchurch, and Rakaia.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. The fore-wings are dark grey
    crossed by four wavy, black-margined, transverse lines; beyond the outermost of these lines
    there is a black band running parallel with the termen, and beyond this again a broader band of
    the ground colour; the orbicular spot is very minute and dull white; the reniform, which is
    surrounded by a black shading, is large, yellow towards the costa, and white towards the termen.
    The hind-wings are dark grey. The females are generally much darker than the males, some
    specimens having the fore-wings very dark brownish-black.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Both sexes vary a good deal in the depth of colouring, but the markings appear to be quite
  constant.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The larva is dark brown, tinged with pink; the subdorsal region is paler, there
    are a series of diagonal blackish stripes on each segment, and the anterior portions of the
    larva are much darker than the rest of the body.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The specimens I reared were fed on lettuce, but I expect that the caterpillar feeds on low
  plants generally. It is full grown about January. The pupa state is spent in the earth.</p>

    oblong, much indented towards the termen, doubly outlined with dull yellow and containing a
    blackish spot towards its lower edge, its posterior margin is shaded with dark brown; there are
    several faint, wavy, transverse lines near the termen, and the termen itself is shaded with
    brownish-black; the cilia are reddish-brown. The hind-wings are dull grey; the cilia are pale
    reddish-ochreous tipped with white. <i>The head is covered with scattered white scales</i>, the
    thorax is reddish-brown, and the abdomen is grey tipped with reddish-brown; <i>the upper joints

  which is generally visible near the bases of the leaves. Owing to the formidable array of spines
  presented by the spear-grass, this larva can have but few enemies. The presence of these spines
  makes the insect a difficult one to obtain without special apparatus. A sharp pair of strong
  scissors, however, will enable the collector to cut off a sufficient number of the "spears" to
  allow of the insertion of a small trowel or hatchet under the root. The plant can then be lifted
  out of the ground, and the larva afterwards carefully extracted from its burrow in the stem. These
  larvæ are full grown about the end of May, which is consequently the best time to obtain them for
  rearing. The pupa is enclosed in an earthen cell amongst the roots of the spear-grass. The moth
  appears in November, December, January, February, and March. It is sometimes attracted by light. I
  have found it commonly on the Tableland of Mount Arthur at elevations of from 3,500 to 4,000 feet
  above the sea-level, where its food-plant also flourishes.</p>

  <p>This pretty species has occurred at Palmerston and Wellington in the North Island, and at
  Blenheim, Christchurch, and West Plains near Invercargill in the South Island. It is probably
  common and generally distributed.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 1&#x215C; inches. <i>The fore-wings are
    pinkish-brown</i>; there is a short black streak near the centre of the wing at the base, and an
    irregular, extensive black marking along the dorsum; <i>the orbicular, reniform, and claviform
    spots are large, margined first with green and then with black</i>; a fine white line is
    situated parallel with the termen, edged with green, and emitting two sharp tooth-like markings;
    beyond this line the ground colour of the wing is dark-brownish-black. The hind-wings are dull
    brown, darker towards termen; the cilia are white with a brown line. The antennæ of the male are
    slightly bipectinated. In the female the ground colour is considerably paler, the black markings
    much darker, and more suffused, and the posterior half of the reniform is usually
    creamy-white.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Some specimens have the green and black markings slightly more pronounced, but otherwise there
  are no important variations.</p>

  <p>The eggs are deposited in October and November. When first laid they are pale greenish-white,
  but become dark brown in the centre as the enclosed embryo develops. The young larvæ emerge in
  about a fortnight. At this time the two anterior pairs of prolegs are very short, causing the
  caterpillar to loop up its back when walking. In colour the young larva is pale brown, with
  numerous black warts emitting several long, stiff bristles. It is very active, and busily devours
  the soft green portions of the dock leaves, leaving the harder membrane untouched. Twelve days
  later the larva becomes pale green in colour, and moults for the first time, after which traces of
  subdorsal and lateral lines present themselves. Growth then proceeds with great rapidity, and in
  another eleven days the larva again sheds its skin. The last moult occurs a fortnight later.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">At this time the larva is pale greenish-brown, inclining to yellow on the ventral
    surface. The lateral lines consist of a series of black markings near the posterior margin of
    each segment; the subdorsal lines are represented by four oblique black marks on each side of
    the four posterior segments of the larva. The region between these lines is much clouded with
    yellowish-green or pink, the larvæ having a tendency to diverge into pink and green varieties.
    The anal segment is dull yellow. The head is brown, with two black stripes and several black
    dots.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Whilst rearing these larvæ I noticed that during the daytime they invariably hid themselves
  under the blotting paper at the bottom of the breeding cage. No doubt, under natural conditions,
  they retreat beneath the ground, only coming abroad at night to feed. This habit would account for
  the difficulty experienced in finding larvæ of this genus in a state of nature.</p>

  <p>The pupa state is spent in the earth, and occupies about a month.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The moth appears towards the end of January. It evidently hibernates through the
  winter, as it is often seen very late in the autumn, and is always one of the first moths to come
  to sugar in the early spring. It is frequently observed at rest on fences and trees in the
  daytime.</p>

  <p>Apparently common in the Canterbury district, where it has been taken at Christchurch and Mount
  Hutt. In the North Island it has occurred in the neighbourhood of Wellington.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">It resembles <i>Melanchra insignis</i> in every respect except that the head,
    thorax, and fore-wings are entirely suffused with green; there is no central black streak at the
    base, and the orbicular, reniform, and claviform spots are smaller.</p>
  </div>

  <p>It varies a little in the intensity of the green colouring.</p>

  <p>The eggs are deposited early in November. At first they are white in colour, but soon become
  dull brown, with two concentric circular markings. The young larva closely resembles that of the
  <i>Melanchra insignis</i>, but is much more sluggish. It feeds on grasses and other low
  plants.</p>

  <p>In about six weeks' time it is full grown, when it still resembles the caterpillar of
  <i>Melanchra insignis</i>, except that its colouring is considerably darker, and a number of
  rust-red spots are situated on the subdorsal line. This larva also appears to spend the daytime
  underground, only coming abroad in the evening to feed. The pupa is concealed in the earth.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect may be occasionally found at rest on tree-trunks in the forest,
  where it is very hard to discover, as it almost exactly resembles a little patch of moss or
  lichen. Specimens are sometimes noticed in the middle of winter, so there is little doubt that
  this species hibernates. It occurs in spring as late as November, and as the pupæ emerge during
  the latter end of January the insect is about for most of the year.</p>

  <p>This is a very abundant species throughout the country.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. The fore-wings are pale
    reddish-brown in the male, grey in the female; the markings are black and somewhat indistinct;
    the orbicular spot is nearly round, the claviform semicircular, the reniform large and not
    margined with black towards the termen; a line runs parallel with the termen, and emits on its
    outer side a tooth-like mark; inside this line the ground colouring of the wing is usually
    lighter. The hind-wings are grey, darker in the male; the cilia are white with a cloudy line.
    The head, thorax, and abdomen are brown in the male, grey in the female. The antennæ are
    slightly bipectinate in the male.</p>

  clouded with dark grey.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The larva is rather stout, with the anterior segments wrinkled. It varies much in
    colour; the dorsal surface is usually reddish-brown; the lateral line is broad and black; a
    series of subdorsal stripes are also black; the ventral surface is green. Sometimes these
    markings are hardly visible, and the larva is entirely green, whilst occasionally the brown
    colouring predominates.</p>
  </div>

  <p>It is a sluggish caterpillar, and feeds on low plants (<i>Plantago</i>, &amp;c.) during the
  whole of the spring and summer. It often frequents the luxuriant growth surrounding logs and
  stones which have long been left undisturbed.</p>

  <p>The pupa state is spent in the earth or amongst moss on fallen trees. When this stage occurs in
  the summer it is of short duration, but in the case of larvæ becoming full grown in the autumn,
  the regular emergence does not take place until the following spring.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The moth may be observed on mild evenings nearly all the year round, but is
  commoner during the summer. It is an extremely abundant species, and is very often seen resting on
  tree trunks during the daytime, in which position the colouring of both sexes will be seen to be
  very protective.</p>

  <p>One of the most abundant of our night-flying moths, occurring in great profusion throughout the
  country.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p>The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. The fore-wings are pale reddish-brown, darker
    towards the middle. There are two elongate, pointed, white markings touching the termen below
    the middle, and a central white streak, interrupted in the middle, by a small semicircular white
    mark, which represents the lower portion of the reniform spot; the orbicular and claviform spots
    are obsolete. The hind-wings are dark grey. The head and thorax are reddish-brown, and the
    abdomen is dark grey. The antennæ are serrate in the male but simple in the female. In some
    specimens the white markings are more extensive than usual, but otherwise there are no important
    variations.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The larva is bright reddish-brown; the dorsal stripe is broad and black; the
    subdorsal narrower, edged with white; the lateral lines are dull red, white, and black; the
    ventral surface, head, legs, and prolegs are greenish-grey with black markings; the spiracles
    are black.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This caterpillar varies considerably in the intensity of the light and dark markings. It feeds
  on grasses in January and September, and is very active. It often occurs in prodigious numbers,
  and at such times may frequently be seen travelling at a great rate over bare ground in search of
  food. Amongst the grass it is hard to detect, as the striped colouring is very protective in that
  situation.</p>

  <p>The pupa state is spent in the earth, or under moss on fallen trees.</p>

  <p>The moth appears from September till April. It is double-brooded. A few of the second brood
  emerge in the autumn and hibernate as moths, but the majority pass the winter in the pupa state.
  Hence we sometimes meet with specimens on mild evenings in the middle of winter.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This insect is much attracted by light, and occasionally assembles in vast numbers
  round a brilliant lamp. I have had as many as one hundred specimens in my verandah at Karori,
  attracted during two or three hours. It is by far the commonest insect at the collectors' sugar,
  the numerous visitors of this species eagerly jostling each other in their haste to obtain a share
  of the sweets. <i>M. composita</i> is likewise observed in the utmost profusion on attractive
  flowers of all kinds, crowding out the rarer and more aristocratic species. Mr. Hanify has drawn
  my attention to the remarkable habit this insect has of suddenly stopping <span class="pagenum"
  id="page23">{23}</span>during its flight, and thus eluding pursuit. It also takes wing with
  unusual rapidity. Specimens of this moth may constantly be observed at rest in various situations
  during the daytime, when the protective character of the colouring will be at once apparent,
  especially when the insect is partially concealed amongst grass. Mr. Meyrick informs us that this
  species is common in Tasmania and South-Eastern Australia.</p>

  <p>This beautiful insect has occurred commonly at Wellington in the North Island, and in the South
  Island, at Blenheim, Christchurch, and Lake Coleridge.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 1¾ inches. <i>The fore-wings, head, and
    thorax are pinkish-grey in the male, pale grey in female; the orbicular spot is rather large,
    nearly round, finely outlined in black; the reniform is very large, margined with black towards
    the base of the wing, and usually touching the orbicular spot or connected with it by a short
    black line</i>; the claviform is triangular, also black margined; there is a cloudy oblique line
    below the reniform, and an irregular line between the reniform and the termen. The hind-wings
    and abdomen are pale pinkish-grey in male, dull grey in female; the cilia are white with a
    cloudy line.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page27">{27}</span></div>

  <p>This insect varies slightly in size, especially in the female. The larva is dull greyish-brown,
  with the subdorsal and lateral lines darker. It feeds on honeysuckle during the summer months.</p>

  <p>The pupa state is spent in the earth.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The moth is very irregular in its appearance. I have captured specimens in January,
  February, March, April, July and September. It appears to pass the winter in both the pupa and
  imago states. It is very partial to light, and in consequence often enters houses.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings of the male is 1&#x215D; inches, of the female 1¾
    inches. <i>The fore-wings are rather pale yellowish-brown, with numerous irregular longitudinal
    grey streaks</i>; there are several very obscure jagged transverse lines, and the stigmata are
    almost invisible; <i>a very broad blackish longitudinal band is situated on the dorsum</i>. The

  <p>This beautiful species appears to be fairly common in many forests in the North Island. It has
  occurred at Wanganui, Masterton, Palmerston, and Wellington. In the South Island it has been taken
  by Mr. Philpott, at West Plains, near Invercargill.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. The fore-wings are bright green;
    there are three paler green transverse lines, edged with black; one near the base of the wing,
    one just beyond the reniform spot, and one close to the termen; this last is inwardly much
    clouded with dark olive-green; the reniform spot is pale green edged with black. The hind-wings
    are very broad, pinkish-brown, tinged with green on the termen. In the female the hind-wings are
    considerably narrower, and are not so strongly tinged with green as in the male.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Some specimens appear to be rather darker than others, but beyond this I have not detected any
  variation.</p>

  <p>The eggs are rather large, globular, flattened above and beneath, and pale green in colour.</p>

  <p>The larva feeds on the mahoe (<i>Melicytus ramiflorus</i>).</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">When first excluded from the egg it is about &#x215B; inch long, and of a very
    pale green colour. After the first moult the caterpillar is bright green, darker towards the
    head, with white dorsal, subdorsal, and lateral lines; there are eight rows of shining black
    spots, each spot emitting a number of stout black bristles; the head is yellowish-brown with a
    few black dots. After the last moult the larva has a totally different appearance. It is pale
    green marbled with darker green; there is often a whitish lateral line, and an obscure series of
    diagonal green stripes on the sides of each segment. Sometimes the whole larva has a
    pinkish-brown tinge, and there are often two or three rows of pale spots. In fact the full-grown
    caterpillar is very variable in its colouring.</p>
  </div>

  <p>These larvæ hibernate during the winter months, often secreting themselves in the burrows which
  have been made in the stems of the mahoe by various species of wood-boring insects. They come
  abroad about the end of August, and are full grown early in October. The pupa state is spent in
  the earth.</p>

  <p>The moth appears in December, January, February, March and April. It is often <span
  class="pagenum" id="page29">{29}</span>found at rest on tree-trunks in the daytime, where its
  beautiful green colouring causes it to resemble, in the closest possible manner, a patch of moss.
  Mr. Hawthorne tells me that he has frequently found dead specimens in this situation.</p>

  <p>This insect is, I think, commoner at slight elevations above the sea-level, forest ranges of
  from 500 to 1,000 feet in height being apparently the most favourable localities for the species.
  The appearance of the moth over so long a period would seem to indicate that there are two
  generations in a year, but I have never found full-grown larvæ in the middle of summer. There is,
  however, no doubt that the insect passes the winter in the larval condition. This species is often
  met with very late in the season, frequenting the few remaining blossoms of the white rata until
  the first or second week in April. Mr. Meyrick thus alludes to the scented tuft of hairs in the
  male insect: "The large tuft of the fore-wings is the source of a very strong vanilla-like
  perfume, which scents the box in which the specimens are contained for more than a week after
  their death; the scent is excited more strongly, even in the dead specimen, by stirring the tuft
  with a pin."<a id="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

  is declining in some other localities also.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is from 1½ to 1¾ inches. The fore-wings are pale
    yellowish-brown, sometimes tinged with red. There is an irregular band of dull grey or brown
    near the termen; <i>the reniform is small and black; the orbicular minute, also black; the
    claviform is obsolete</i>; there are several very indistinct traces of transverse lines towards
    the base of the wing. The hind-wings are dull yellow, <i>with a very broad, blackish, terminal
    band</i>. The head and thorax are yellowish-brown, and the abdomen is dull yellow.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This insect varies a good deal in the ground colouring of the fore-wings, which ranges from
  dull yellow to brick-red, or even to dark yellowish-brown. The hind-wings are also much darker in
  some specimens than in others.</p>

  <p>The larva feeds on the seeds and flowers of various plants. It is extremely variable in its
  colouring.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">Some specimens are dull green, with a few obscure red spots on the sides of the
    anterior segments. Others are brownish-black, with many fine yellow stripes and dots, and the
    red spots confined to the three anterior segments. Others, again, have numerous olive-green,
    white, and pale green lines, with a reddish blotch on the side of nearly every segment.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This caterpillar is often rather destructive in gardens. Amongst other things, it devours
  tomatoes and peas, the flowers and young fruit of pumpkins and vegetable marrows, the flowers and
  leaves of geraniums, veronicas, &amp;c. It is full grown in the autumn.</p>

  <p>The pupa is concealed in the earth, the insect remaining in this condition until the following
  summer.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page33">{33}</span></div>

  <p>The moth appears in January and February. It often flies by day, and may then be seen
  disporting itself amongst the flowers of the Scotch thistle. Its larva may also be found feeding
  on these flowers.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This insect is practically cosmopolitan; it has occurred in the following
  countries: Australia, Samoa, India, Ceylon, Madagascar, Africa, Europe, North and South America.<a

  <p>This insect is probably generally distributed in the North Island, and in the northern portions
  of the South Island. It has occurred very commonly at Taranaki, Napier, and Nelson, but in
  Wellington it is rather a scarce species.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. The fore-wings are dark grey with
    bronzy reflections; there is a pale band on the termen, and several of the transverse lines are
    indicated by paler colouring, the two basal ones being often silvery; <i>the orbicular is partly
    outlined with golden-white, and the claviform is wholly filled in with the same colour</i>. The
    hind-wings are yellowish-grey, darker towards the termen.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Mr. Meyrick mentions a variety in which the characteristic golden-white discal spots on the
  fore-wings are absent. I have not yet had the good fortune to see this form, and think it must be
  a rare one.</p>

  <p>The larva has twelve legs; it is much attenuated towards the head; its colour is pale green,
  darker on the back; there is a number of wavy white lines and dots on the larva, as well as a few
  isolated black dots and hairs. It feeds on geraniums, mint, bean, Scotch thistle, and many other
  garden plants and weeds. Its original food appears to have been the "potato plant" (<i>Solarium
  aviculare</i>); but now it only occurs on this shrub in uncultivated localities, where there is no
  European vegetation.</p>

  <p>The pupa is enclosed in a cocoon of white silk, generally situated between two dead leaves on
  or near the ground.</p>

  <p>The moth first appears about September, and continues abundant until the end of summer. In
  Nelson I have seen it in great profusion, hovering over various flowers in the evening, at which
  time it also occasionally endeavours to gain access to beehives. In the same locality I have met
  with the young larvæ in the middle of winter, so that there is probably a continuous succession of
  broods all the year through in favourable situations.</p>

    line at about one-third; <i>the reniform is very large, crescentic, steely blue, finely margined
    first with black, then with orange, and <span class="pagenum" id="page36">{36}</span>then again
    with black; the centre of the crescent is filled in with black; beyond this spot there are three
    fine black wavy transverse lines emitting three very sharp teeth between the reniform and the
    dorsum</i>; there is a faint shaded line near the termen. The hind-wings are rich brown,
    slightly paler than the fore-wings; there are three shaded, wavy, transverse lines. The termen
    of both wings is slightly scalloped with a minute bluish-white dot at each indentation; the
    cilia are dark brown.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The life-history is thus described by Mr. Colenso:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The larva when full grown is about 3¾ inches in length, elongate, slightly
    thicker in the middle, and with the skin smooth. It is ash-colour, speckled with minute points
    of black and red; two minute carmine spots are situated close together on its back; and, when in
    motion, two large triangular black splashes are also visible. The under side of the larva is
    dull white, with several dull olive spots corresponding to its ventral prolegs. Its head is
    small, and pale Indian yellow in colour; its anal and ventral prolegs are large; on being
    touched the caterpillar coils itself up very rapidly and closely.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The specimen from which Mr. Colenso's description was taken, was found at rest on the trunk of
  a large acacia-tree, which is probably the food-plant of the larva.</p>

  <p>The pupa is enclosed in a cocoon formed of leaves fastened together with silk. The insect
  appears to remain in this condition for about two months.</p>

  <p>The pupa-case (after emergence) is nearly cylindrical, very obtuse at the head, and tapering
  regularly downwards from the end of the wing-cases, with the tail conical; the abdominal segments
  are very strongly marked. Its colour is dark red, with a bluish or violet bloom, but smooth and
  shining on its prominent parts.<a id="NtA_23" href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears in January, February, and March, but it is rather a

    between the orbicular and the reniform.</i></p>
    <p>Some male specimens are much paler in colour than others, but with this exception there does
    not appear to be any important variation.</p>
    <p>The eggs are round, flattened above, bright green, becoming dull purplish about two days
    after being laid.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The young larva when first emerged is about &#x215B; inch in length; the head is
    brown; the body dull white, with a series of black tubercles round each segment, each tubercle
    emitting a tuft of bristles. The larva has sixteen legs, but the two anterior pairs of ventral
    claspers are not employed in walking, the caterpillar's mode of progression, consequently,
    resembling that of a larva with twelve legs only. The food-plant is <i>Piper excelsum</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The perfect insect appears from September till April, and is very common amongst undergrowth in
  the forest. It is seldom found in the daytime, but at night it is extremely abundant in densely
  wooded situations. It flies in a very stealthy manner, and may soon be recognised on the wing by
  this feature alone. When disturbed it always secretes itself amongst dead fern fronds or other
  vegetable refuse, where its sombre colour effectually conceals it.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The costal fold on the under side of the fore-wing of the male contains a very
  large tuft of extremely long hairs. It probably emits a scent agreeable to the female.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 1 inch. The fore-wings have the costa
    straight, and the termen with a large projection slightly above the middle; the colour is pale
    brown; <i>there is a broad dark brown patch on the costa at the base</i>, a jagged transverse
    line at about one-fourth, <i>a very broad, oblique, blackish-brown, oblong patch on the costa at

    brownish-black just before the apex</i>, and an obscure transverse line; there is a series of
    minute, dark brown, crescentic marks on the termen. The hind-wings are dull whitish-grey; there
    is a faint blackish dot in the middle, a wavy line a little below the middle, and a terminal
    series of small dark marks. The antennæ are filiform in both sexes.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The perfect insect appears in October, November and December. It frequents dense forest
  ravines, and is generally disturbed from amongst dead leaves or old fern fronds. It is usually a

  <p>This is a very extensive group of the Lepidoptera, and so far as it is represented in New
  Zealand is equivalent to that group formerly known as the <i>Geometrina</i>, with the addition of
  the family <i>Sphingidæ</i>. The insects here included comprise many of our most interesting,
  abundant, and beautiful species. Some of them are so extremely variable that it is often a matter
  of considerable difficulty to determine the most convenient points on which to base the specific
  distinctions; although fortunately great advances have been made in this direction of late years
  owing to the increase in the number of workers, and the consequent accumulation of available
  material. In connection with this portion of the subject, special mention should be made of Mr.
  Meyrick's paper on the group, which appeared in the 'Transactions' of the New Zealand Institute
  for 1883. This essay has been of the greatest value in dispelling the doubts which formerly
  existed respecting the limits of many of the most variable species.</p>

  <h3>Genus 1.&mdash;TATOSOMA, Butl.</h3>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">"Face smooth. Palpi long, straight, porrected, shortly rough-scaled, terminal
    joint short. Antennæ in male simple, stout, gradually dilated from base to near apex, apex
    attenuated. Abdomen in male very excessively elongate. Hind-wings in male deeply excised near
    dorsum, dorsal lobe folded into a long pocket, fringed with hairs. Fore-wings with vein 6 rising
    out of 9, 7 from or above angle of areole, 10 anastomosing moderately with 9, 11 anastomosing
    moderately with 10, 12 free. Hind-wings with veins 6 and 7 separate, 8 free, united with 7
    before transverse vein by an oblique bar.</p>
  </div>

  <p>"This singular genus is a remnant of a widely diffused, but now fragmentary group, to which
  belong also <i>Lobophora</i> (Europe), <i>Rhopalodes</i> (South America), <i>Sauris</i> (Ceylon),
  and <i>Remodes</i> (Borneo.) In all, the hind-wings of the male are peculiarly modified, usually
  much diminished in size, and with the dorsum formed into a distinct lobe, the object of which is
  unknown. A similar structure is found only in one or two genera of <i>Tortricina</i>.
  <i>Rhopalodes</i> is the nearest genus to this, but vein 5 is said to be obsolete, and the lobe
  does not form a pocket; in <i>Sauris</i> the areole is simple, and the antennæ thickly scaled; in
  <i>Remodes</i> the areole is also simple, the antennæ flattened and scaled, and the dorsum is
  furnished with three superposed lobular folds, so that it represents the extreme of development in
  this direction."&mdash;(Meyrick.)</p>

  <p>It will be seen on reference to Plate <a href="#plate2">II</a>., figs. 22 and 23, which
  represent the structure of the hind-wings of the male and female of <i>Tatosoma agrionata</i>
  respectively, that in the male veins 1 and 2 are absent, having no doubt become absorbed during
  the formation of the characteristic sexual lobe; vein 8 is connected with the margin of the cell
  by an oblique bar, this being probably due to an extension of the wing in the costal region,
  compensating for the loss in the dorsal region due to the above-mentioned lobe. In the hind-wings
  of the female the normal neuration of the family is almost preserved, the only peculiar feature
  consisting in the origin of veins 6 and 7 from a point on the margin of the cell.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Of this remarkable genus we have three species, and I think it quite possible that
  others may reward the industry of future collectors.</p>

  <p>This fine species has occurred commonly at Wellington in the North Island. It is generally
  distributed in the South Island, and has also been found at Stewart Island.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. <i>The fore-wings are bright-green
    traversed by numerous black, wavy, transverse lines; these black lines are grouped into four
    more or less distinct bands, the outermost of which is interrupted at each of the veins</i>;
    there is a conspicuous black dot in the middle of the wing, a number of small triangular black
    marks near the termen, and a series of minute black dots on the termen. The hind-wings are
    ochreous, tinged with green towards the termen. In the female the abdomen is much shorter, and
    the hind-wings are larger than in the male.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears from December till April. It frequents dense forests,
  and is generally found at rest on the trunks of trees. In these situations the pattern of the
  fore-wings is extremely protective, the whole insect bearing the closest possible resemblance to a
  patch of moss. This species may also be taken at sugar, and sometimes at light, but I have found
  that it can be obtained most plentifully by a careful scrutiny of the tree-trunks in a favourable
  locality. As a rule I think that the males are considerably commoner than the females. I have
  noticed them in the proportion of about four to one.</p>

    covered with scales. The fore-wings of the male are dull reddish-brown, with numerous obscure
    transverse dusky stripes; there are two rather conspicuous blackish blotches on the costa</i>, a
    white dot in the middle of the wing, a wavy, pale, transverse line near the termen, and a series
    of black terminal dots; the veins are dotted in black. The hind-wings are very small, dull grey,
    with the lobe large and conspicuous. <i>The female is faintly tinged with green, the markings on
    the fore-wings are rather indistinct</i>; the hind-wings are small, though much larger than
    those of the male.</p>

  <h3>Genus 2.&mdash;PARADETIS, Meyr.</h3>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">"Palpi short, arched, roughly-scaled beneath. Antennæ bipectinated. Fore-wings

  </div>

  <p>"This singular genus is of quite uncertain affinity, and stands at present alone. The simple
  areole, and connecting bar of 7 and 8, can only have arisen by modification of the normal type of
  this family, to which it must be referred. It is also the only New Zealand genus except
  <i>Declana</i> in which the female has pectinated antennæ; but this character recurs in a few
  exotic genera not otherwise allied."&mdash;(Meyrick.)</p>

  the Otira Gorge, and Lake Wakatipu.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about ¾ inch. <i>The fore-wings of the male are
    deep purplish-brown</i>; there is a wavy, reddish, transverse line at about one-third and
    another at about two-thirds; between these two lines near the dorsum there are often four, more
    or less distinct, yellow dots; there is an obscure orange mark at the origin of the first line
    and a conspicuous mark at the origin of the second. <i>The hind-wings are deep
    purplish-brown.</i> The cilia of all the wings are white. <i>The fore-wing has the apex hooked
    and the termen deeply excavated above and below the middle.</i> The female is very much paler;
    the lines are more distinct and the veins are marked in brown.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp5">The perfect insect appears in January. It frequents rather open spots in the
  forest, and flies in a very busy manner close to the ground amongst the numerous ferns and other
  plants, which are always abundant in such situations. It is consequently very inconspicuous and
  sometimes difficult to capture. Thus, no doubt, it is often overlooked, and perhaps is much
  commoner than at present appears probable.</p>

  <p>This pretty species has occurred at Wellington.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about ½ inch. All the wings are traversed by
    numerous obscure, wavy, reddish-yellow lines; the fore-wings have a dark shading near the base,
    <i>a very large white blotch in the middle</i>, and a dark chocolate-brown patch near the apex.
    <i>The hind-wings have a large shaded white patch in the middle</i>, a blackish dot near the
    base, and a series of brownish crescentic marks on the termen; the cilia of all the wings are
    pale brown barred with brownish-black. The termen of the fore-wings is very oblique, of the
    hind-wings rather irregular.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Many specimens of this insect are strongly tinged with green, and the shape and size of the
  white patches on the fore- and hind-wings are subject to slight variations.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is ¾ inch. <i>The fore-wings are bright green with
    numerous wavy darker lines.</i> There is a jagged transverse black line near the base, two at
    about one-fourth, enclosing a rather paler space; beyond this there are several rather
    irregular, fine black marks, and an obscure white patch below the apex; the cilia are dull
    green. The hind-wings are grey slightly tinged with reddish; the dorsum and termen are shaded
    with green, and there is a number of curved black lines on the dorsum; the cilia are dull
    greenish-grey. The termen of the fore-wings is slightly bowed, and all the wings are finely
    scalloped and sharply outlined in black.</p>
  </div>

  <p>A very distinct variety frequently occurs in which the entire ground colour is
  <i>orange-yellow</i>. This variety can be artificially produced by exposing a typical specimen to
  the fumes of bruised laurel leaves. Intermediate forms may also be found, but are much scarcer
  than either the typical form or the variety.</p>

  <p>The larva (according to Mr. Purdie<a id="NtA_26" href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>) is about ½
  inch long; colour brownish, surface very rugged; body tapering somewhat towards the head. Two
  pairs of small dorsal tubercles about the middle, the posterior pair being larger; oblique lateral
  dark markings faintly seen on dark ground colour; below lighter. Food-plants: <i>Aristotelia</i>,
  <i>Leptospermum ericoides</i>, <i>Rubus</i> (?), and <i>Muhlenbeckia</i> (?). Found in December
  and January.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears from September till May, and is often very common. It
  rests on tree-trunks with outspread wings, in which position it so closely resembles a patch of
  moss that it is extremely difficult to detect, even when specially searched for.</p>

  <p>This species was discovered by Mr. Philpott at West Plains, near Invercargill.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is &#x215E; inch. The fore-wings are rather dull
    green; there is a reddish-brown patch near the base, followed by two, slightly oblique, reddish
    bands; the central band is very broad, green, traversed by numerous fine wavy lines; there is a
    broad reddish band on the termen. The hind-wings are slaty-grey, tinged with pink towards the
    termen and dorsum. The cilia of all the wings are pink barred with black.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Two other specimens kindly given to me by Mr. Philpott have the bands on the fore-wings more or
  less brown in place of red, but are otherwise identical.</p>

  <p>This insect is evidently very closely allied to <i>C. bilineolata</i>, but its larger size,
  longer wings, and barred cilia will, I think, distinguish it from that species.</p>

    irregular patches on the termen, sometimes forming a dark brown terminal band; all the markings
    are much darker on the costa, and portions of the costa, termen, and dorsum are frequently
    tinged with green. The hind-wings are pale ochreous; there are numerous wavy, pale brown lines

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect may be met with from September till February, but is most
  abundant in the early spring. It is extremely common in the Wellington Botanical Gardens,
  frequenting the forest gullies, where numerous specimens may be easily dislodged from amongst the
  dense undergrowth. This moth rests with expanded wings on the leaves and stems of shrubs, but is
  extremely difficult to find in such situations, the colouring of the insect causing it to closely

  cream-coloured blotches towards the base or middle of the forewings.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears from September till March, but is not a common species.
  It frequents forest districts, and may sometimes be found at rest on tree-trunks, where the
  beautiful colouring of its fore-wings closely imitates that of certain lichens, and renders its
  detection in such situations extremely difficult. Unlike the insects included in the two preceding
  genera, this species closes its wings when at rest, the anterior pair alone being visible. These
  wings are not held flat, but are curiously folded longitudinally, and the end of the abdomen is
  also curled upwards. By slightly raising the insect above the level of the surrounding surface,
  this peculiar attitude considerably increases its resemblance to a lichen growing on the stem or
  branch of a tree. It will also be observed that in this species, which when at rest exposes only
  its fore-wings, these alone are protectively coloured; whilst in the genera <i>Chloroclystis</i>
  and <i>Phrissogonus</i>, where both pairs of wings are displayed, both pairs are protectively
  coloured.</p>

  <p>This species is extremely variable, but may generally be recognised by a careful scrutiny of
  the above-named characters. One very striking variety occasionally met with has the central band
  of the fore-wing completely divided in the middle, which thus forms two dark patches, one on the
  costa, and one on the dorsum. (See Plate <a href="#plate7">VII</a>., figs. 7 and 8.) A further
  development of this variety, of which I have only seen one example, taken by Mr. Hawthorne at
  Springfield, Canterbury, and now in his collection, has only the costal patch present, the whole
  of the lower portions of the band being completely obliterated.<a id="NtA_28"
  href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>  (See Plate <a href="#plate7">VII</a>., fig. 9.) The minor
  varieties are too numerous to specify.</p>

  <p>The larva feeds on grasses. When full-grown its length is about 1 inch. The colour is dark
  brown, with the skin very much wrinkled. It is sluggish in its habits, and lives through the
  winter, becoming full-grown about the end of September. During severe weather it generally seeks
  refuge from the elements amongst the stalks and roots of the rank herbage often surrounding stones
  or fallen logs.</p>

  <p>The pupa is concealed in the earth.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears early in January, and continues in the utmost profusion
  until the middle or end of March. It may often be seen resting with the wings folded backwards and
  forming together a triangle, whence the moth has probably derived its name of <i>deltoidata</i>.
  In the neighbourhood of Wellington I have observed that this insect has very much decreased in
  numbers during the last ten or fifteen years.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p>The expansion of the wings is 1¼ inches. <i>The fore-wings are dark brown, with the veins and
    margins broadly shaded with bright green; there are numerous irregular wavy blackish streaks
    forming three ill-defined darker transverse bands</i>; the first at the base; the second from
    one-fourth to about two-thirds, partially divided into two from the costa downwards; and the
    third near the termen outwardly edged with white. The termen itself is bordered first with
    green, and then with a series of fine black marks; the cilia are dark brown. The hind-wings are
    very pale reddish-brown, darker towards the dorsum, with numerous pale brown wavy transverse
    lines. There is a series of black crescentic marks on the termen, and the cilia are pale
    reddish-brown.</p>
    <p>This species is rather variable. The spaces between the darker bands on the fore-wings are
    usually green, but in some specimens this is partially or wholly replaced by pale
    yellowish-brown. The dark bands also vary considerably in width and distinctness, and in many
    specimens the central band is entirely divided by a conspicuous pale brown or green transverse
    space.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The larva, according to Mr. Purdie, is about 1 inch long, cylindrical. Back a
    dull deep green; lateral stripe reddish-white, edged below with a darker colour; ventral side
    lighter green, with four parallel white or yellow lines close together, extending from the
    forelegs to the prolegs. Outer side of prolegs white. There are traces of a median dorsal stripe
    of brownish-red on the anal segments. Beaten from <i>Coprosma</i>. Found in January. Mr. Purdie
    states that he is not quite certain as to the identification of the species, as the median belt
    of the fore-wings is much more distinctly defined, and the colour is a duller green than is
    usual in <i>H. similata</i>.</p>

  <p>This beautiful little insect has occurred at many localities throughout both the North and
  South Islands. It is probably a common species in most wooded districts.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is almost an inch. <i>All the wings are very pale
    greenish-white with numerous faint green, wavy, transverse lines.</i> The fore-wings have a more
    or less distinct brown band on the costal edge, and a conspicuous greenish central dot. The
    hind-wings often have a slight projection on the termen near the middle.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The perfect insect appears from October till May, and frequents dense forest undergrowth. It is
  chiefly attached to the Kawakawa (<i>Piper excelsum</i>), and may often be found resting with
  outspread wings on the under-surfaces of the leaves of this plant, where it is very inconspicuous.
  There are probably two or more broods during the summer.</p>

  <p>On the 11th of May, 1892, I observed large numbers of this species flying over the Manuka
  bushes in the Wellington Botanical Gardens in brilliant moonlight. The night was very cold, but
  notwithstanding this the moths were most numerous and active. The appearance of this insect under
  such unusual conditions may have been quite accidental, as I have never seen a recurrence; but one
  is often somewhat unobservant in the winter, hence the record of this observation may be of use in
  directing the attention of others to the subject.</p>

  <p>This pretty species is common, and generally distributed throughout the country.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p>The expansion of the wings is nearly an inch. <i>All the wings vary from very pale brown to
    rather dull purplish-brown; there are numerous jagged, darker, transverse lines forming several
    more or less distinct bands.</i> The first of these bands extends from the base to about
    one-eighth; the second, composed of only two or three lines, is situated at about one-third; the
    third extends from <span class="pagenum" id="page53">{53}</span>three-fourths to about
    five-eighths; there are in addition, numerous very fine, wavy lines near the termen. The spaces
    between these bands are paler, and in some specimens the bands are very conspicuous, whilst in
    others they are hardly perceptible. One specimen in my collection (Plate <a
    href="#plate6">VI</a>., fig. 39) has a very broad chocolate-brown band across the middle of both
    pairs of wings, the remaining portions being unusually pale in colour. There is always a dark
    brown dot in the centre of each wing, and a series of very fine dots on the termen.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The larva, which feeds on Manuka (<i>Leptospermum</i>), is very ornamental. Its
    general colour is light green, with black dorsal and lateral stripes, and a series of diagonal
    markings bordered with crimson; the legs and prolegs are also crimson, and the segments are
    divided by brilliant yellow rings, a white line extending down each side of the larva.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This caterpillar is difficult to find, as it remains closely concealed amongst the dense Manuka
  foliage, from which it can be dislodged only by vigorous and continued beating. The larvæ allow
  themselves to fall a short distance, hanging suspended by a silken thread, which they rapidly
  ascend when the danger is past.</p>

  <p>The pupa is enclosed in a slight cocoon about one inch below the surface of the earth.</p>

  <p>The perfect insect appears from October till April. It is very common in most situations where
  its food-plant is found and, owing to its pale colour, is readily seen when flying in the evening
  twilight. Specimens may also be taken in the daytime resting with outspread wings on the trunks of
  trees and on fences, where they are much more easily detected than many other species.</p>

  <p>This remarkable species has occurred at Wellington in the North Island, and in the South Island
  at Christchurch, Ashburton, Dunedin and West Plains.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. <i>All the wings are pale
    yellowish-brown, with many straight oblique parallel dull brown lines; on the fore-wings there
    are three lines broader and more isolated than the rest, running from the apex to the
    dorsum</i>; on the hind-wings the lines near the middle are rather thicker than the others, and
    have a broad space on each side of them; <i>all the lines are clearly marked on the abdomen, so
    that each line appears to be continuous from one side of the moth to the other</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears from October till May, and frequents the Cabbage Tree
  Palm (<i>Cordyline</i>), on which its larva probably feeds. According to Mr. Fereday the moth
  always rests on the dead leaves of the plant, keeping its wings in such a position that the lines
  are continuous with the parallel veins of the dead leaf, which they precisely resemble in
  appearance. We have, I think, in this species a most instructive instance of special adaptation to
  surrounding conditions; and the action of natural selection, in preserving favourable variations
  of colour and habit, appears to be here unmistakably indicated. Had our investigations been
  confined to the examination of cabinet specimens only, we might <span class="pagenum"
  id="page54">{54}</span>have long remained in the dark as to the explanation of such an unusual
  type of wing-marking.</p>

  <p>This handsome insect has occurred in the South Island at Mount Arthur and at Lake Guyon.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is a little over 1 inch. <i>The fore-wings are bright
    yellow; there is a broad pale reddish-brown band on the costa; a conspicuous oval dark brown
    spot above the middle</i>, often touching the costal band; a double series of minute brown dots
    near the termen. The hind-wings are pale yellow, with a double series of minute brown dots
    parallel to the termen.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears in January, February, and March. It is apparently a rare
  species. Mr. Fereday has six specimens taken at Lake Guyon, and I have two specimens captured on

  at Nelson, Mount Hutt, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Lake Wakatipu in the South Island.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is hardly an inch. <i>All the wings are pale yellow
    with a variable number of fine jagged reddish-brown transverse lines, which are usually most
    distinct towards the termen.</i> The fore-wings have a broad band of reddish-brown along the
    costal edge; a blackish dot above the middle just touching the costal band, and a small brown
    mark near the apex. The hind-wings have a minute black dot a little above the middle.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This species is rather variable: in some specimens the transverse lines are much broader,
  forming bands of reddish-brown; in others the whole of the wings are dull reddish-brown, except a
  small yellow area near the base; whilst others are <i>entirely dull greyish-brown with the
  transverse lines very faint</i>, intermediate varieties between all these forms also
  occurring.</p>

  <p>The larva, according to Mr. Purdie,<a id="NtA_31" href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> is about ½
  inch long, feeding on the Ribbonwood (<i>Plagianthus betulinus</i>). The ground colour is green,
  with the dorsal and lateral stripes white. The dorsal stripe is interlined with short black
  dashes, and there is a dark blotch about the ninth segment. The dorsal and lateral stripes may be
  margined with purplish-red. The under side is green. The larvæ were found in April.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears from November till February, and frequents forest.
  According to my experience it is rather a local species, although plentiful where found. Mr.
  Meyrick states that it is "very common in bush, from August to February, and in May."<a

    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 1 inch. The fore-wings are dull ochreous;
    there is a series of fine brown and reddish wavy transverse lines near the base, forming a
    rather broad basal band; then a pale central area containing a blackish dot above the middle;
    next, a very distinct band made up of several fine wavy grey lines, with a rounded projection
    near the middle; this is followed by numerous pale brown curved marks forming more or less
    broken transverse lines; <i>there is always an oblique slaty patch below the apex</i>, and a
    series of minute dots on the termen. The hind-wings are ochreous brown, slightly darker towards
    the base, with numerous indistinct wavy brown lines. <i>The apex of the fore-wing is very
    pointed and slightly hooked downwards; the termen is bowed near the middle.</i> The female is
    much duller and more uniform in colour than the male, and the antennæ are simple.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This species is very variable. Some male specimens have several more or less distinct white
  markings on the middle of the fore-wings; the transverse bands also differ considerably in both
  size and intensity. The females are not so variable; but in some specimens the bands on the
  fore-wings are almost absent, whilst others have the fore-wings rich brown, with a very
  conspicuous dark central band.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is from &#x215D; inch to 1 inch. <i>The fore-wings

  <p>The variation existing in this species is very great, and is thus described by Mr. Meyrick:<a
  id="NtA_38" href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> "Three main forms occur: one large, greyer, and more
  uniform; a second of middle size whiter and generally strongly marked sometimes bluish-tinged,
  only found in the hills; and a third small greyish but ochreous-tinged, strongly marked; these are
  connected by scarcer intermediate forms, and are, I believe, due to the direct effect of food and
  situation.</p>

  <p>"The larva feeds on lichens."</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears from October till March, and frequents a great variety
  of situations. The colouring of the fore-wings is beautifully adapted for protection on
  lichen-covered banks, rocks, or fences, where specimens may often be found resting with closed
  wings during the daytime. This species flies rather freely at evening dusk, and may then be taken
  plentifully at sugar, blossoms or light. It is, however, a difficult matter to procure specimens
  in really good condition for the cabinet, as the insect is so extremely restless when confined in
  a box that if it is not killed at once, it will speedily injure itself during its struggles to
  escape. This moth is found at elevations ranging from the sea-level to 3,500 feet.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p>The expansion of the wings is about 1&#x215B; inches. <i>The fore-wings are bright
    orange-yellow; the base is speckled with black and dull green scales; there is a rather
    indistinct band at about one-third; a broad wavy dark brown band a little beyond the middle,
    with a projection towards the termen, followed by a clear space and another broad irregular dark
    transverse band</i>; the termen is broadly bordered with dark brown, which is often almost
    continuous with the last-named transverse band. <i>The hind-wings are bright orange; there is a
    large speckled area near the base edged with a curved black line, followed by a clear space, and
    an interrupted dark brown transverse line considerably beyond the middle</i>; the termen is
    rather narrowly edged with a dark brown line, wavy towards the base of the wing. The cilia of
    all the wings are yellow barred with black.</p>
    <p>The species varies considerably in the extent of the dark markings, especially on the
    fore-wings.</p>
    <p>The egg is oval and white, without sculpture.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The young larva, which is very attenuated, has sixteen legs. Its colour is pale
    yellowish-brown above, and dull ochreous beneath. The food-plant is unknown.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears from October till March, and frequents open, grassy
  situations. At Wellington, during October and November, it is common on the cliffs close to the
  shores of Cook's Strait, flying very rapidly on hot, sunny days, which renders its capture very
  difficult in such steep situations. Mr. Fereday's specimens were obtained amongst the tussock
  grass at the foot of Mount Hutt. The insect was also found plentifully on the slopes of Mount
  Arthur, at an elevation of about 4,500 feet above the sea-level, and also on the Tararua Range in

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about ¾ inch. The fore-wings are <i>dark
    bluish-grey</i>, with numerous slender, wavy, blackish transverse lines, and a distinct blackish
    dot above the middle. The hind-wings are <i>bright orange</i>, speckled with grey near the base

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears in January, frequenting shingle flats on the mountain
  sides, at about 4,000 feet above the sea-level. It flies rapidly in the hottest sunshine, and,
  when it alights on the stones, is extremely difficult to find. The brilliant hind-wings, which are
  very conspicuous when the moth is flying, quite disqualify the eye from detecting the extremely
  obscure object, which the insect instantly becomes when resting with its fore-wings alone exposed.
  This method of increasing the value of protective tints by means of bright colours temporarily
  displayed was very clearly described, I believe for the first time, by Lord Walsingham in his
  address to the Fellows of the Entomological Society of London, in January, 1891. It is certainly
  well exemplified by this and several other species of the genus <i>Notoreas</i>, and it will be at
  once noticed by the collector, how extremely difficult it is to follow these active little moths,
  as they fly with short and rapid flight over the grey rocks and stones, with which their
  fore-wings so completely harmonize; the momentary glimpse obtained of the brilliant hind-wings so
  completely deceives the eye, that there is much more difficulty in marking the spot where the
  insect alights, than would have been the case if the brilliant colour had never been
  displayed.</p>

  <p>This species has occurred in tolerable abundance at many localities in both the North and the
  South Islands. It is probably generally distributed throughout the country.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is from 1 inch to 1½ inches. The wings range in colour
    from pale yellow to dark orange-brown, dark reddish-brown, or even dull brown, with innumerable
    intermediate tints. There is often a central transverse line reaching from the costa of the
    fore-wing to the dorsum of the hind-wing. Many of the varieties are speckled with darker colour;
    others have irregular yellow patches, generally situated on the fore-wings just below the apex
    and on the dorsum near the base; there are often two white dots near the apex of the
    fore-wings.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Most of the varieties closely resemble the varied hues of fading leaves. In many of the forms
  greyish speckled marks occur on various parts of the wings, no doubt imitating the irregular
  patches of mould which are often present on dead leaves. One very well-marked variety is bright
  yellow, with the costa rosy and two large white-centred rosy spots arranged transversely on each
  wing. (See Plate <a href="#plate8">VIII</a>., fig. 47.) All the specimens of this insect are so
  extremely variable that it is almost impossible to adequately describe the species. The apex of
  the fore-wing is always very acute; the termen is bowed just below the apex, and is furnished with
  slight indentations of variable depth. The termen of the hind-wing is also furnished with variable
  indentations.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p>The egg is oval and much flattened above. When first laid it is pale green in colour, but
    becomes dull olive-green as the embryo develops.</p>
    <p>The young larva is <i>very pale green</i>, with the head brownish-yellow. At this early stage
    its colouring already completely harmonises with that of the under side of the leaves of its
    food-plants, <i>Pittosporum eugenioides</i> and <i>P. tenuifolium</i>.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The full-grown larva is very robust, and about 1 inch in length. Its colour is
    pale green, with numerous yellow dots and a series of diagonal yellow stripes on each segment;
    there is, in addition, a series of broad crimson blotches on the back and a small crimson flap
    projecting from the end of the terminal segment; the prolegs and spiracles are also crimson.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">The remarkable shape and colouring of this caterpillar, in conjunction with the
  peculiar attitude assumed when at rest, affords it complete protection, causing it to resemble, in
  the closest possible manner, one of the buds of its food-plant. These larvæ grow very slowly, and
  probably occupy three or four months in attaining their full size. They are very sluggish in their
  habits. The pupa is greenish-brown in colour. It is enclosed in a cocoon, constructed of two or
  three leaves of the food-plant, fastened together with silk. The insect remains in this condition
  for three weeks or a month. The moth first appears about the end of October, and is met with until
  the middle of March. It frequents forest, where it is occasionally dislodged from amongst the
  undergrowth. It is also found in the evening on the flowers of the white rata. It is, however,
  rather uncertain in its appearance, being much commoner in some years than in others.</p>

  <p>This remarkable-looking species has occurred in the North Island, at Auckland and Wellington.
  At present it has not been observed in the South Island.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page81">{81}</span></div>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is from 1&#x215C; to 1&#x215D; inches. All the wings
    are pale ochreous-brown, with a variable number of minute black dots; there are four or five
    oblique, wavy brown transverse lines on both fore- and hind-wings, the central and terminal
    lines being often slightly darker than the others; there is always a black dot in the middle of
    the fore-wing, and a shaded spot near the termen below the apex. The apex of <i>the hind-wing is
    very pointed and projects downwards; the almost straight termen has a series of prominent
    projections</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This species varies much in the intensity of the markings, and in the number of the black dots
  on both the fore- and hind-wings. The peculiar outline of its hind-wings, however, distinguishes
  it from any other species with which I am acquainted.</p>

  <p>The larva feeds on veronicas in September and October.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">Its length when full grown is about 1 inch. Some larvæ are green, with a broad
    bluish dorsal line, and two fine yellow lateral lines. Others are brown, with a dull yellow
    dorsal line.</p>
  </div>

  <p>During the daytime these caterpillars firmly clasp the stem of their food-plant with their
  prolegs, and hold the rest of their body rigidly out from the branch. In this position they are
  very inconspicuous, and may readily be mistaken for young leaves or twigs. At night they become
  much more active, and may then be seen walking about and feeding.</p>

  <p>The pupa is rather robust, with a sharp spine at its extremity. Its colour is pale olive-brown,
  with the wing-cases and sides of the abdomen pinkish. It is not enclosed in any cocoon, but is
  merely concealed amongst the dead leaves and rubbish around the stem of the veronica. The insect
  remains in this state for less than a month, so that the protection of a cocoon would appear to be
  unnecessary.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The moth appears in December and January. It usually frequents gardens and other
  cultivated places, probably on account of the number of veronicas that are often growing in such
  situations. It is also attracted by blossoms and by light, but is not a common species. The
  colouring and wing-outline of this moth cause it to very closely resemble a dead leaf, especially
  when resting amongst foliage or on the ground. This insect may be occasionally noticed abroad on
  mild evenings in the middle of winter; the females probably hibernate and deposit their eggs early
  in the spring.</p>

  </div>

  <p>"A very large family, equally common throughout all regions. It varies considerably in
  superficial appearance, and is also remarkable for the variability of structure of veins 10 and 11
  of the fore-wings in many (not all) species. Imago with body slender to rather stout; fore-wings
  broad to rather elongate, triangular; posterior tibiæ of male often enlarged and enclosing an
  expansible tuft of hairs. The structure termed the fovea is a circular impression on the lower
  surface of the fore-wings above the dorsum near the base, usually placed about the origin of the
  basal fork of 1<i>b</i>; it is generally confined to the male, and is often sub-hyaline, sometimes
  surmounted by a small thickened gland; it may possibly be a scent-producing organ. It is strictly
  confined to that branch of which <i>Selidosema</i> is the type, but is not invariably present
  there.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">"Ovum subcylindrical or elongate-ovate, more or less reticulated, sometimes
    ribbed. Larva elongate, more or less slender, with few hairs, without developed prolegs on

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. The fore-wings of the male are
    <i>very pale</i> ochreous-brown; there is a double jagged transverse line near the base, a
    single jagged line a little before the middle, and a double one a little beyond the middle; an
    almost continuous jagged line near the termen. The hind-wings are very pale ochreous, almost
    white; <i>their outline is peculiar; the dorsum is very short, the termen very long, first
    oblique and then rounded with a small projection midway between the apex and the tornus</i>. The
    female has the fore-wings pale grey, and the hind-wings dull white; the markings resemble those
    of the male, but the outline of the hind-wing is of the usual form.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This insect varies slightly in the depth of its colouring. It may be distinguished from the
  allied species by the peculiar outline of the hind-wings in the male, and by the pale grey
  colouring of the female.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears from October till March and is very common. It has a
  great liking for the faded fronds of tree-ferns, from which specimens may often be dislodged. Both

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings of the male is 1½ inches, of the female 1&#x215D;
    inches. The fore-wings are <i>very pale ochreous-brown</i>; there are two interrupted jagged
    transverse lines near the base; a single very indistinct line in the middle; a double, nearly
    continuous jagged transverse line beyond the middle; a double jagged line near the termen
    completely interrupted in the middle; there is generally a dark patch on the termen just below
    the apex of the wing. The hind-wings are very pale ochreous. There is a series of black dots on
    the termen of both fore-wings and hind-wings, and the termen of the hind-wing is slightly
    indented.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This species varies a good deal in size; the specimens from Stewart Island are <span
  class="pagenum" id="page83">{83}</span>considerably larger and have more distinct markings, than
  those found in the vicinity of Wellington.</p>

  <p>The larva is cylindrical, of even thickness throughout, and almost uniform dull greyish-brown
  in colour, occasionally with a series of small oblong black marks on segments 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
  It feeds on the young leaves and buds of the ake ake (<i>Olearia traversii</i>). It is extremely

  <p>This species is very common and generally distributed throughout the country, and has occurred
  as far south as Stewart Island.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is 1¼ inches. The fore-wings of the male are <i>dull
    yellowish-brown, speckled with black</i>; there are two curved transverse lines near the base; a
    very obscure line near the middle, darker on the costa; two doubly curved lines beyond the
    middle, slightly darker on the dorsum; and two very faint jagged lines near the termen. The
    hind-wings are pale ochreous, tinged with brown near the termen. The female has narrower wings,
    shorter body, and is usually duller in colour than the male.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This insect is rather variable, some specimens of both sexes being much darker than others; but
  all the forms may usually be recognised by their dull speckled colouring and absence of
  conspicuous markings.</p>

  <p>The larva feeds on the white rata (<i>M. scandens</i>) and the tawa (<i>Beilschmiedia
  tawa</i>).</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">Its length when full grown is about 1&#x215B; inches. The upper surface is dark

    eighth segment.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The pupa is concealed amongst refuse on the ground, the larva constructing no cocoon before

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.3ex;"><span class="smaller">(Plate <a href="#plate9">IX</a>.,

  <p>This inconspicuous-looking insect has occurred at Wellington.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings of the male is about 1&#x215B; inches. <i>The
    fore-wings are dull yellowish-brown; there are three short oblique dark brown stripes on the
    costa, inclined very much towards the termen</i>; the first of these stripes is distinctly
    double, and the second and third partially so; there is an indistinct brown mark just below the
    apex, several slender faint streaks on the veins near the middle of the wing, and a very
    distinct brown shading on the dorsum. The hind-wings are very pale ochreous.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This species may be readily distinguished from the other species of the genus by its small size
  and by the obliquity of the costal stripes. In <i>S. humillima</i> the costal markings slope very
  rapidly from the base towards the termen; in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page84">{84}</span>other allied species these markings are but slightly inclined, and in some
  cases slope in the reverse direction.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears from December till March. It frequents the immediate

  <p>This species is very common, and generally distributed throughout both the North and South
  Islands. It has also occurred at Stewart Island.</p>

  <p>The expansion of the wings of the male is 1&#x215C; inches, of the female 1&#x215B; inches.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The fore-wings vary from pale yellowish-brown to rich chocolate-brown; there are
    two curved transverse lines near the base, generally enclosing a paler stripe between them; next
    a broad dark central area; then a wavy paler transverse line, usually followed by a very much
    paler irregular band, generally formed by two partially disconnected patches, one on the costa
    and one on the dorsum; there is a jagged, whitish, transverse line near the termen, <i>always
    broken in the middle</i>, and often shaded with black towards the base of the wing. The
    hind-wings are ochreous, speckled with brown towards the dorsum; there is usually a brown
    central dot.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This is an extremely variable insect. In some specimens there are very extensive white patches
  on the wings, whilst in others the colouring is almost uniform rich brown, and the characteristic
  markings can only be detected with difficulty. It may, however, be distinguished from the allied
  species by the <i>interrupted pale jagged transverse line near the termen and by the absence of
  greenish colouring</i>.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p>The eggs are oval with the surface honeycombed; they are pale green in colour.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The young larva, when first hatched, is much attenuated, light reddish-brown with
    a broad pale lateral stripe, and a few bristles. The full-grown larva measures about 1½ inches
    in length; it is rather slender and has a large hump on the sixth segment. Its colour is dark
    reddish-brown, mottled and striped with dull white and greenish.</p>
  </div>

  <p>It feeds on the white rata (<i>Metrosideros scandens</i>). During the day it firmly grasps a
  stem of its food-plant with its prolegs, holding the rest of its body out from the branch in a
  perfectly straight and rigid position. When in this attitude it so exactly resembles a twig, that,
  even in the case of captive specimens, it is often a matter of the greatest difficulty to find a
  caterpillar amongst the branches. Several times I have even caught hold of a larva, thinking it to
  be a twig, so perfect is the resemblance. At night these larvæ become much more active, and by the
  aid of a lantern they may then be seen busily walking about and feeding.</p>

  <p>The pupa is enclosed in a slight cocoon about two inches below the surface of the earth. The
  larvæ of the autumnal brood remain in this condition during the winter, but in the case of the
  spring and summer broods the pupa state only occupies a few weeks.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The moth appears from November till May. It is very common in forest regions, and
  may be observed resting on the trunks of the trees, its pale yellow hind-wings being completely
  concealed by the mottled brown fore-wings. In this position the insect is almost invisible, and
  the protection afforded by its colouring is at once apparent. In the autumn evenings it is often
  very abundant at the blossoms of the white rata.</p>

    ochreous-brown; there is a small white-edged brown spot near the base; two oblique curved brown
    transverse lines enclosing between them a white space towards the dorsum; a short stripe on the
    costa, near the middle, edged with white towards the base of the wing; a doubly curved
    transverse line beyond the middle, finely edged with white towards the base of the wing; there

    transverse line, the two lines enclosing between them a small pale triangular area; there are
    five short longitudinal brown lines running from the termen to the outermost of the transverse
    lines, two of them being tipped with white towards the base of the wing. The hind-wings are dull
    ochreous-brown, with two very faint brown transverse lines towards the dorsum, and several
    whitish spots and one brown spot near the tornus. The female is a little darker in colour than
    the male.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This insect varies slightly in size.</p>

  <p>The larva feeds on <i>Cyathea dealbata</i> (tree-fern) in September. Its colour is dull

    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings of the male is 1¼ inches, of the female 1½ inches. The
    fore-wings are <i>dull greenish-grey</i>, with black markings; there is a transverse line near
    the base; another near the middle, followed by two broken irregular lines, then a broader, paler
    area sometimes white, followed by a series of jagged pale markings shaded with black. The
    hind-wings are ochreous mottled with pale brown near the dorsum; there is a series of black dots
    on the termen of both fore- and hind-wings.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This species is extremely variable, but may always be recognised by its greenish tinge, and the
  absence of indentations on the termen of both fore- and hind-wings.</p>

  <p>The larva, according to Mr. Purdie, is about ¾ inch long; dull green with darker longitudinal
  striations. It may be beaten from New Zealand broom (<i>Carmichælia</i>) in February. There must
  be some other commoner food-plant, as the moth is found in many localities where the New Zealand
  broom does not occur.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears from November till March, and is generally very abundant
  in all wooded districts. It is also common in birch forests on the mountain sides, where it may be
  taken at altitudes of from 3,000 to 4,000 feet above the sea-level. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page86">{86}</span>In the lowlands I have observed as many as half a dozen specimens on a
  single tree-trunk. Whilst resting in this situation they are very inconspicuous, the colouring of
  the fore-wings harmonizing perfectly with the insect's surroundings, and the pale-coloured
  hind-wings being then entirely concealed by the upper pair. In connection with this fact it is
  very interesting to notice that in all those cases where the hind-wings are exposed to view during
  repose, they are protectively coloured in a similar manner to the fore-wings. It will be observed
  that the two following species of <i>Selidosema</i> exhibit protective colouring on both pairs of
  wings, these being invariably exposed when the insects are at rest.</p>

  <p>This large insect is very common, and generally distributed throughout the country.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is from 1½ to 2 inches. The fore-wings vary from pale
    ochreous to very dark rich brown; there is an oblique transverse line near the base, often
    enclosing a darker basal area; a small dark brown spot in the middle of the wing surrounded by a
    ring; a very oblique, wavy, transverse line beyond the middle, often double towards the dorsum,
    and several irregular markings on the termen; there is often a white spot on the middle of the
    termen, and a pale blotch on the apex of the wing. The hind-wings resemble the fore-wings in
    colour; there are two obscure transverse lines near the base; generally forming a dark basal
    area; a wavy line near the middle, and a strongly shaded line near the termen. The termen of
    both the wings is indented, the depth of the indentations varying greatly in different
    specimens.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This insect is very variable, but its large size and <i>oblique transverse lines</i> suffice to
  distinguish it from any of the other allied species.</p>

  <p>The larva feeds on a great variety of plants, mahoe (<i>Melicytus ramiflorus</i>), white rata
  (<i>Metrosideros scandens</i>), <i>Solanum aviculare</i>, fuchsia (<i>Fuchsia excorticata</i>),
  and <i>Pennantia corymbosa</i> being amongst the number. The caterpillar may often be recognised
  by a large hump, which is situated on each side of the third segment. Its colouring appears to be
  so entirely influenced by its surroundings that a description is impossible. For instance, larvæ
  taken from the pale green foliage of the mahoe resemble in colour the twigs of that plant; others
  captured feeding on the white rata are dark reddish-brown, those from <i>Solanum aviculare</i> are
  purplish slate-colour, whilst those from the fuchsia are pale olive-green tinged with brown, like
  the sprouting twigs.</p>

  <p>The pupa is enclosed in a slight cocoon situated about two inches below the surface of the
  ground. Those larvæ which become full grown in the autumn remain as pupæ during the winter, but
  the summer broods only remain in the pupa state a few weeks.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears from November till March. It has a great partiality for
  resting with outspread wings on the walls of sheds and outhouses, where it is frequently noticed
  by the most casual observer. It is very common in most situations, and may be taken in large
  numbers at sugar, light, or blossoms, during the whole of the summer. Its extreme abundance and
  great variability, in both the larval and imago states, would render it a good subject for a
  series of experiments, resembling those conducted by Messrs. Poulton and Merrifield on several
  allied European species.</p>

  <p>This species is very common, and generally distributed throughout the country. It has occurred
  as far south as Stewart Island.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is from 1½ to 1¾ inches. The fore-wings of the male
    vary from pale yellowish-white to rich brown or dark brownish-black; there is a jagged
    transverse line near the base; a large black or white spot in the middle of the wing; a doubly
    curved transverse line beyond the middle, then a very jagged transverse line, followed by
    several paler markings, and an obscure line parallel with the termen. The hind-wings are paler
    in colour; there is a slightly curved transverse line near the base; a jagged line near the
    middle, and a very faint line beyond the middle. The termen of both fore- and hind-wings is
    slightly indented. The female varies from pale ochreous to dark slate-colour; the markings
    resemble those of the male, but the termen of the wings is more indented.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This species is so extremely variable that a more detailed description would be useless; its
  numerous forms may, however, be at once recognised by the <i>unbroken jagged transverse lines of
  both fore- and hind-wings</i>.</p>

  <p>The larva is quite as variable as the perfect insect. When very young it is bright green, with
  a conspicuous white dorsal line; as age advances the caterpillar becomes dark olive-brown,
  sometimes striped with paler brown or green, whilst many specimens retain the green colouring
  throughout the whole of their lives. The favourite food-plant is the kawa-kawa (<i>Piper
  excelsum</i>), which the larvæ voraciously devour, thus causing the riddled appearance which the
  leaves of that plant almost invariably present. These larvæ often select a forked twig to rest in,
  where they lie curled round, with the head and tail close together. Other food-plants are
  <i>Aristotelia racemosa</i> and <i>Myrtus bullata</i>. Those caterpillars found on the latter
  plant are strongly tinged with pink, and are consequently very inconspicuous amongst the young
  shoots, where they generally feed. The burrows of the larvæ of <i>Hepialus virescens</i> are
  frequently utilised by the caterpillars, which feed on the <i>Aristotelia</i>, as convenient
  retreats during the winter. When full-grown these caterpillars descend to the ground and construct
  loose cocoons of silk and earth on the under sides of fallen leaves. The moth usually emerges in
  about a month's time, but the autumnal larvæ either hibernate or remain in the pupa state
  throughout the winter.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears from October till April. It frequents forest and is
  extremely common. It also occurs in great abundance on the white rata blossoms in the autumn, and
  specimens may be occasionally seen even in the depth of winter.</p>

  <p>This species is very abundant in the neighbourhood of Wellington. It has also occurred at
  Palmerston North, and is probably common throughout the whole of the North Island. In the South
  Island it has been taken in the Otira Gorge, and at Dunedin, Otara and Invercargill.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 1&#x215C; inches. <i>The fore-wings of the
    male vary from pale orange-brown to dull yellowish-brown</i>; there is a doubly curved dark
    brown transverse line near the base; <i>a broad straight line a little before the middle; a very
    strongly curved line a little beyond the middle, and a less strongly curved line near the
    termen, often composed of a series of triangular white dots edged with dark brown</i>; all these
    lines are much stronger on the costa, and are sometimes almost obliterated elsewhere. The
    hind-wings are pale yellow, with several brown-edged white spots at the tornus, and an
    indistinct line parallel to the termen. The apex of the fore-wing is considerably produced, and
    there is a large rounded projection on the termen. The hind-wings have several small projections
    on the termen. In the female the fore-wings are pale yellow or orange, the transverse lines and
    white spots are usually more conspicuous, and the projections on the termen of the fore- and
    hind-wings larger.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This is a very variable insect, especially in the male, some specimens of which sex are very
  much clouded and dappled with dark brown both on the fore- and hind-wings. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page89">{89}</span>Many of these darker forms might readily be taken for distinct species,
  when compared with the pale orange-brown variety, but a good series of specimens presents numerous
  intermediate forms which completely connect these extreme varieties. The females also vary, but
  are never as dark as the males.</p>

  <p>The larva feeds on <i>Todea hymenophylloides</i>, a fern which grows in shady places in the
  depths of the forest. The length of the caterpillar when full grown is about 1¼ inches. It is very
  variable; some specimens are dull brown, with a row of green or pale brown lunate spots down each
  side, and a dark brown line down the back. Others are bright green, with a diagonal reddish-brown
  stripe on the side of each segment; the segmental divisions are reddish-brown, intersected by
  numerous very minute whitish lines.</p>

  <p>The pupa is enclosed in a loose cocoon on the surface of the ground.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears from November till March, and is very common in forest
  regions. It may often be dislodged from the dead fronds surrounding the stems of tree-ferns, and
  is also met with in great abundance towards the end of summer on the blossoms of the white

  Islands; it also occurs plentifully at Stewart Island.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is 1&#x215C; inches. <i>The fore-wings are pale

    middle. The hind-wings are ochreous, with a series of minute brownish dots across the
    middle.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This is a variable species. The fore-wings are often much clouded with rich brown, and in some
  specimens scarcely a trace of the original purplish colour remains; the central straight
  transverse line is often absent, and the other lines are frequently very indistinct, except on the
  costa; the dots on the hind-wings are also often absent, and occasionally specimens are met with
  in which all the wings are almost white.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The larva is rather elongate, dull yellowish-brown or greenish-brown; there is a
    very broad dark brown dorsal line, and several wavy lateral lines; the prolegs are black, the
    spiracles are also black; there is a slight hump on the posterior edge of each of the last six
    segments, the hump on the penultimate segment being considerably larger than the others. The
    length of the caterpillar when full grown is about 1 inch.</p>
  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page90">{90}</span></div>

  <p>It feeds on <i>Pteris incisa</i>, a beautiful pale green fern, attaining a height of four feet
  or more, and growing in open situations in the forest. This fern is especially abundant on old
  decaying logs situated amongst light brushwood. When disturbed these larvæ immediately drop to the
  ground and coil themselves up. In this situation they are very inconspicuous, as their colouring
  so closely resembles that of the faded fronds or stems of the fern.</p>

  <p>The pupa is buried in the earth about two inches below the surface, the insect remaining in
  this state during the winter months.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The moth first appears about September, and continues in great abundance until the

    pinkish-brown; there is a black dot in the middle, and a curved blackish transverse line a
    little beyond the middle, being a continuation of the transverse line of the fore-wing; beyond
    this line, and on the dorsum, there are generally several small blackish markings. The female
    has the fore-wings <span class="pagenum" id="page91">{91}</span>orange-red, speckled with
    darker; there is a doubly curved transverse line near the base, and an almost straight

    shaded with dark brown. The hind-wings are pale reddish-orange, with a curved blackish
    transverse line. In both sexes the apex of the fore-wing is projecting, and there is a strong
    angular projection on the termen a little before the middle; the termen of the hind-wing has
    several small projections.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The variation of this insect is considerable, especially in the male. The ground colour of the
  fore-wings often inclines to dull brown, or even dull yellowish-brown; the light and dark
  mottling, and the greyish markings near the termen are sometimes hardly visible; there is often a
  yellowish blotch opposite the large angle in the termen of the fore-wing. The hind-wings also are
  very variable in their colouring. All these varieties exist in the female in a less pronounced
  degree.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears during the first week in February, and is generally over

  <p>This species is very abundant in the neighbourhood of Wellington. It has also been taken at
  Taranaki, Christchurch, Dunedin, Invercargill and Stewart Island, and is probably common and
  generally distributed throughout the country.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. All the wings of the male are
    yellowish-brown; there is a faint transverse line near the base, and a conspicuous darker
    transverse line running from a little before the apex of the fore-wing to the middle of the
    dorsum of the hind-wing; there is also a dark spot in the centre of the fore-wing, often
    containing two white dots. In the female, all the wings are slate-coloured; the transverse lines
    are very faintly indicated, and the central dot of the fore-wing is reddish-brown. The apex of
    the fore-wing in each sex is conspicuously hooked, and the termen is bowed and sometimes has a
    very slight angle in the middle.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Both sexes of this insect are very variable. In the male, the ground colour ranges from
  dingy-brown to bright orange-brown; the transverse lines differ much in intensity, and in some
  specimens the central area of the wings enclosed by them is much darker than either the basal or
  the marginal portions; occasionally there is a series of black markings between the outer
  transverse line and the termen of the fore-wings, whilst the transverse line itself is frequently
  edged with a band of paler <span class="pagenum" id="page92">{92}</span>colouring. The female also
  varies in the ground colour and in the intensity of the transverse lines, which are sometimes
  marked by a few black dots.</p>

  <p>The larva, according to Mr. Purdie, is light grey, cylindrical, about &#x215D; inch in length.
  It may be beaten in February from an undergrowth of <i>Carpodetus</i> and <i>Aristotelia</i>.</p>

  <p>The perfect insect appears from November till March. It frequents dense forest and is often
  very abundant. The colouring of the upper and under surfaces of its wings, and the shape of the
  wings are both very protective, giving the moth an exact resemblance to a dead leaf. When
  disturbed, the insect adds to this deception by keeping its wings quite motionless and rigidly
  extended, and allowing itself to fall through the air like a leaf. The resemblance in this case to
  the inanimate object is very perfect, and has no doubt enabled the moth to escape from many
  enemies. It is, in fact, an extremely interesting example of the simultaneous development of
  structure and instinct in a useful direction, through the agency of natural selection.</p>

  <p>This species is very common in the neighbourhood of Wellington. It has also occurred at
  Palmerston North, Makotuku, Christchurch, Dunedin and Stewart Island.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is 1¼ inches. The fore-wings of the male vary from
    pale yellowish-brown to bright orange-brown, or reddish-brown; there is a wavy transverse line
    near the base, often obsolete except on the costa; another wavy transverse line beyond the
    middle, also frequently obsolete except on the costa; <i>followed by a very conspicuous straight
    line, often double, running obliquely from a little before the apex to the dorsum</i>; outside
    this line, near the tornus, there are, in most specimens, two black spots or one large rust-red
    spot; the termen has two projections near the apex, inside which there is usually a darker
    blotch. The hind-wings are as variable in colour as the fore-wings; there is one wavy line near
    the base, <i>followed by an almost straight line</i>, which is a continuation of the straight
    line of the fore-wing; beyond this line the ground colour is generally much darker; the termen
    itself has no projections. The female has broader wings and a shorter body than the male; the
    ground colour and markings are similar to those of the male, but are usually more sombre, and
    the termen of both fore- and hind-wings is furnished with a number of prominent projections. The
    under side of the wings in both sexes is beautifully marbled with yellow and reddish-brown, and
    several of the markings of the upper surface are faintly indicated.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This species, as will be seen from the foregoing, is so extremely variable that a more detailed
  description would be useless, especially as the straight, oblique, transverse lines of both fore-
  and hind-wings will at once distinguish it from the two other members of the genus.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page93">{93}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears from November till March. It frequents dense forest, and

  recorded from any other locality.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is 1½ inches. The fore-wings of the male are pale
    orange-brown; there is a doubly toothed shaded transverse line near the base, the teeth being
    marked with two black spots; <i>a conspicuous wavy transverse line runs from the apex to the
    dorsum</i>, and is also marked with several black dots; the space between the two transverse
    lines is paler than the rest of the wing; there is a row of small black dots on the termen, and
    the termen itself has two small projections. The hind-wings are yellowish at the base, becoming
    orange beyond the middle; there is a faint brownish transverse line near the base, and a
    conspicuous wavy transverse line at the middle, marked by a series of black dots; this central
    transverse line divides the yellowish ground colour of the basal area, from the orange ground
    colour of the rest of the wing. The female is larger and duller than the male; the fore-wings
    are yellowish drab, with the outer transverse line dull red; there is a series of minute black
    dots on the termen; the hind-wings are dull yellow, with a wavy central transverse line.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The only variety of this species which has come under my observation is a male. In this

  <p>This insect is evidently closely allied to <i>Azelina fortinata</i>. It may, however, be
  distinguished from that species by the smaller projections on the termen of the fore- and
  hind-wings, and the dotted transverse lines of the male.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears from January till April. It is met with much later in
  the season than either of the two other species of <i>Azelina</i>. It frequents forest, and may be

  <p>This species is common in the neighbourhood of Wellington, and I expect generally distributed
  throughout New Zealand; but as there appears to have been some confusion in Mr. Meyrick's papers
  between it and the female of <i>Declana junctilinea</i>, I am unable to assign the localities
  there mentioned to either of the species.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings of the male is 1½ inches, of the female 1&#x215C;
    inches. The fore-wings of the male are uniform pale brownish-ochreous, generally with two
    transverse series of minute darker brown dots parallel to the termen, and two or three similar
    dots near the middle of the wing. There is a series of very small parallel brown lines on the
    costa. The hind-wings are greyish-brown with two very deep indentations in the termen. The
    female has the fore-wings pale grey, and the hind-wings darker grey; the markings and outline
    resemble the male.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In a few male specimens I have observed four large black spots on the fore-wings, two near the
  base, and two near the termen. All these spots are sometimes joined together by a very broad black
  band, which extends along the whole of the central portion of the fore-wings. I have also a male
  specimen in which the fore-wings are entirely marbled with dark grey. In the female two or three
  moderately large spots are occasionally present on the fore-wings, near the termen. All these
  varieties appear to be much scarcer than the typical form.</p>

  <p>The larva, which feeds on manuka (<i>Leptospermum</i>), has ten legs. It is rather slender,
  dark brown, mottled with grey and dull red. There are two large tubercles on the sides of the
  seventh and eighth segments. It is a sluggish caterpillar and is generally seen in a motionless
  condition, clasping the stem of its food-plant with its prolegs, and holding the rest of its body
  in a perfectly rigid position like a small branch. The pupa is enclosed in a cocoon of silk and
  refuse on the surface of the ground.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears in January, February and March. It is a forest-dwelling
  species, and may often be captured in some numbers, at dusk, on the flowers of the white rata
  (<i>M. scandens</i>). It is very sluggish and nearly always drops to the ground when disturbed and
  feigns death.</p>

  <p>This very handsome and conspicuous insect appears to be restricted to the North Island, where
  it is rather rare. It has occurred at Wellington, Otaki, and Napier.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings of the male is 1&#x215D; inches, of the female nearly
    2 inches. The fore-wings are <i>brilliant shining white, with numerous black markings</i>; these
    consist chiefly of three irregular branching transverse bands, and a series of wedge-shaped
    spots on the termen; the larger markings are brownish in the centre. The hind-wings are dark
    grey, becoming almost black on the termen, with a fine wavy transverse black line.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This species varies considerably in the size and shape of the black markings on the fore-wings,
  which are often slightly different on the opposite sides, in the same specimen.</p>

  <p>The eggs of this moth are oval in shape, slightly roughened on the surface and light blue in
  colour. They are deposited towards the end of October. The young larva escapes by gnawing a hole
  out of the side.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p>When first hatched it is dull brownish-black, with creamy-white lateral lines and prolegs;
    the head is reddish. It feeds on <i>Panax arborea</i>. After the first moult the lateral lines
    become much wider, especially towards the head. After the second moult the two dorsal tubercles
    are fully developed, the thoracic segments much swollen and flattened above, the latter bearing
    traces of the black markings of the full-grown larva. After the third moult the larva becomes a
    dark brownish colour inclining to chocolate on the dorsal surface. The characteristic markings
    on the penultimate and anal segments of the adult larva now appear, and the dorsal tubercles are
    yellowish in colour; the extra prolegs are very small, and are visible as wart-like appendages
    on the lower surface of the tenth segment.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The full-grown caterpillar is a remarkable-looking animal. The head is very
    small; the first three segments of the body are enormously swollen and flattened above, the
    flattened portions being white, with several small black ring-shaped markings; there is a pair
    of large yellowish tubercles on the dorsal surface of the seventh segment, and two smaller ones
    on the tenth and eleventh segments; the larva is much stouter towards the posterior extremity,
    especially behind the ninth segment; the penultimate segment is furnished with a large
    creamy-white ridge, starting on the back and proceeding downwards and forwards; the extra pair
    of prolegs is small and only occasionally used in walking. The general colour of the larva is
    brownish- or blackish-green; the tenth and eleventh segments are generally darker, and there are
    many fine parallel lines of darker colouring on the central portions of the larva; the whole
    insect is also speckled with black; the spiracles are red. The larva varies a good deal in
    colour, but its peculiar structure will at once distinguish it from any other.</p>
  </div>

  <p>These larvæ often coil themselves up when at rest, clinging firmly with their large prolegs to
  their food-plant. Whilst thus engaged they have a very remarkable appearance. I have not yet
  ascertained the precise object of the peculiar shape and coloration of this caterpillar. It
  appears to resemble very closely a lichen-covered twig, but I suspect in this case there is
  something more special aimed at.</p>

  <p>In connection with this subject, it is noteworthy that the flattened extremities of the elytra
  of the beetle, <i>Ectopsis ferrugalis</i>, closely resemble in both shape and colour the
  remarkable anterior segments of the larva of <i>D. atronivea</i>. As both insects feed on the same
  plant, and thus exist under very similar conditions, it is highly probable that the peculiarities
  have been independently acquired in each species for similar purposes.</p>

  <p>The pupa is enclosed in a light cocoon amongst dead leaves, &amp;c, on the surface of the
  ground.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page96">{96}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears in February and March, and may sometimes be taken at
  blossoms in the evening. It is also attracted by light, and has been found occasionally, in the
  daytime, resting on tree-trunks. It hibernates during the winter, coming abroad again the
  following spring to lay its eggs. I have observed that a good many pupæ from the autumnal brood do
  not emerge until September or October, so that the insect evidently spends the winter both as a
  pupa and as an imago.</p>

    broad subdorsal lines. The under surface of the larva is pale green. There is a series of fleshy
    filaments of a pinkish-brown colour along each side of the insect, and an extra pair of prolegs
    on the ninth segment.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This caterpillar is, however, very variable, its colouring appearing to depend largely on its
  surroundings. The favourite food-plants are <i>Leptospermum ericoides</i> and <i>Aristotelia
  racemosa</i>. The larvæ found on the former plant are usually pale yellowish-brown, whilst those
  from the latter are much darker brown, often mottled with grey like the stems of the
  <i>Aristotelia</i>. A specimen I once found on a mountain beech (<i>Fagus cliffortioides</i>), the
  gnarled stem and branches of which were covered with grey lichens and mosses, was mottled with the
  most beautiful shades of greenish-grey. These larval varieties are very interesting, and in order
  to test the direct influence of food on the colouring of the larvæ, I once divided a batch of eggs
  deposited by a single female into two equal parts, and fed one half on <i>Aristotelia</i>, and the
  other half on <i>Leptospermum</i>. The differences in colouring between the two lots of larvæ thus
  treated were, however, of the most trivial description. This somewhat surprised me at first, as I
  had previously observed quite distinct varieties on each plant, when found in a state of nature.
  Hence I am now disposed to think that these differences have been brought about gradually, by
  natural selection acting on larvæ feeding on the same plant for a large number of generations. By
  this means a sufficient amount of variation might be accumulated, to cause the closest possible
  approximation in colouring to the stems of the several food-plants. It is also noteworthy that
  many of these food-plants grow in widely dissimilar localities, so that the free inter-breeding of
  insects dependent on them would not be likely to occur, and thus the peculiarities of colouring
  adapted to the stems of each food-plant would not be disturbed by the effects of
  inter-breeding.</p>

  <p>In connection with the foregoing experiment it is also interesting to observe, that the
  specimens fed on <i>Aristotelia</i> matured much more rapidly than those on <i>Leptospermum</i>;
  the former plant evidently being the more nourishing food for the larvæ. Also that out of the
  batch fed on <i>Aristotelia</i> 28 became moths, of which 12 were males and 16 females; whilst out
  of those fed on <i>Leptospermum</i> only 24 became moths, of which 15 were males and 9 females. In
  all other respects, excepting food-plant, the two lots of larvæ were subjected to identical
  treatment.</p>

  <p>During the day this larva rests quietly attached to the stem of its food-plant, where it is
  very difficult to detect, as the filaments so closely embrace the twig or tree-trunk that the
  whole insect exactly resembles a swelling in the stem.</p>

  <p>The pupa of <i>D. floccosa</i> is enclosed in a loose cocoon on the surface of the ground.</p>

  <p>The perfect insect appears about September, and continues in more or less abundance until the
  end of April. There are most likely several broods in a season, and, as we frequently meet with
  specimens of the moth on mild days in the middle of winter, it probably also hibernates.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This insect is usually observed at rest on fences and tree-trunks, where its grey
  mottled colouring causes it to closely resemble a patch of lichen.</p>

  <p>This handsome insect often occurs in the northern portions of the North Island, but becomes
  very rare southward of Napier and New Plymouth. In the South Island it has been taken at Nelson,
  and recently a very mutilated specimen of what appears to be this species has been found by Mr.
  Philpott, near West Plains, Invercargill. With these exceptions I have not heard of its appearance
  in any other localities in the South Island.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 3½ inches. The fore-wings are greyish-brown
    with several irregular, darker markings near the base; and a broad, dark, central band; beyond
    the central band there is a very irregular, pale grey, toothed line. The hind-wings are
    yellowish-grey, with four transverse, darker stripes, the outermost one strongly toothed. The
    head and thorax are dark grey, paler on the back, with two conspicuous tufts of pale grey hair
    on the shoulders. <i>The abdomen is grey, striped on the sides with rose-colour and
    black.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The larva feeds on <i>Convolvulus</i>. Like many of the caterpillars of the <i>Sphingidæ</i>,
  there are two very distinct varieties: one is bright green, with white spiracles, and a series of
  diagonal yellow lines above them; the other is dull yellowish-brown, with broad blackish-brown
  dorsal and ventral lines, and a series of triangular blackish spots above the spiracles, which in
  this variety are jet-black. In both these forms of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page100">{100}</span>larvæ the anal horn is dark red tipped with black, and the skin is
  covered with numerous fine wrinkles. The length of the caterpillar when full grown is 3½
  inches.</p>

  <p>About the middle or end of February these larvæ generally bury themselves in the ground, where
  they are transformed into pupæ. They remain in that condition until the following summer.</p>

  <p>The pupa is about 2 inches in length and is of a dark mahogany-brown colour. It is furnished
  with a large curved process, projecting from the lower side of the head, and containing the
  enormous proboscis of the future moth.</p>

  <p>The perfect insect appears in November and December. It flies with incredible velocity at
  evening dusk, and is often observed hovering over flowers, and whilst poised in the air above
  them, extracts the honey with its long proboscis. Mr. A. P. Buller has very kindly furnished me
  with the following interesting notes on the habits of this species, as observed by him in the
  Auckland district<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"During the summer of 1879 I came across <i>S. convolvuli</i> in great numbers, near Ohinemutu,
  in the Hot Lake district, frequenting at dusk a tall, delicately perfumed meadow flower
  (<i>&#x0152;nothera biennis</i>, commonly called the evening primrose). They were to be seen on
  the wing soon after sundown, and on warm, still evenings literally swarmed. It was an extremely
  pretty sight to watch their rapid movements as they darted from flower to flower, never alighting,
  and keeping up a constant vibration of their wings as they probed the yellow blossoms. They
  appeared to be extremely local, for I only met with them on a few of the grassy slopes round the
  shores of Lake Rotorua. I visited the same locality two years later, at the same season, and only
  occasionally saw one, although the evening primrose was in full bloom at the time. In 1882 I
  captured several at flowers of the trumpet-tree (<i>Brugmansia</i>) in a garden near Auckland. The
  same summer I found large numbers of the larvæ at Waiwera (near Auckland), on a species of
  convolvulus growing in profusion on the sandhills in the vicinity. Although the larvæ were so
  abundant I never came across the perfect insect. I obtained some twenty or thirty of the pupæ, but
  unfortunately was never successful in hatching out the imago. As far as my knowledge goes, this
  beautiful moth is confined to the Auckland and Waikato districts, although I have heard of a
  single specimen being taken in Hawkes Bay."</p>

  <p>I am also much indebted to Mr. Buller for the loan of a very perfect specimen of this moth,
  expressly lent to me for figuring and describing in the present work.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Mr. Meyrick informs us that this insect occurs throughout Europe, Asia, Africa,
  Australia and the islands of the South Pacific, wherever a suitable situation is found, and has
  been met with far out at sea.<a id="NtA_43" href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> In America it is
  represented by a form which seems to be regarded as specifically distinct, but which he thinks is
  probably identical. If this be the case the insect is practically cosmopolitan.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">"Head rough-haired. Ocelli absent. Tongue developed. Antennæ slender, dilated
    apically, forming a gradual or abrupt club. Labial palpi moderately long, more or less
    rough-haired, terminal joint rather pointed. Maxillary palpi obsolete. Thorax more or less
    hairy. Fore-wings with 1<i>b</i> simple, 1<i>c</i> absent, 5 usually from or above middle of

    rising out of cell near base, rapidly diverging."&mdash;(Meyrick.) (See Plate <a
    href="#plate1">I</a>., figs. 7, 8, 15, 16, 25, 26, 27.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>This is one of the most interesting groups of the Lepidoptera. The insects comprised in it are
  popularly known as butterflies, and from their bright colouring and conspicuous appearance are
  always favourites with beginners. The <i>Papilionina</i> attain great development in the tropics,
  especially in South America, where, it is said, a single valley sometimes contains as many species
  as the whole of Europe. In New Zealand there are only fifteen species of butterflies, the group
  being extremely poorly represented both here and in the South Pacific Islands.</p>

  <p>Formerly the <i>Papilionina</i> was known as the <i>Rhopalocera</i>, and was regarded as
  constituting a division of equivalent value to the remainder of the Lepidoptera, which was termed
  the <i>Heterocera</i>. For some time past entomologists have, however, practically abandoned this
  classification of the order, the <i>Heterocera</i>, or moths, being clearly composed of several
  groups each of equivalent value to the <i>Rhopalocera</i>, or butterflies. Mr. Meyrick states in
  his 'Handbook of British Lepidoptera' that the <i>Papilionina</i> "stands rather conspicuously
  isolated at the present day, but there is little doubt that its origin must be traced to the
  <i>Thyrididæ</i>, a family of the <i>Pyralidina</i>."</p>

  <p>In this group the wings are generally held erect in repose, the under surface of the hind-wings
  and the apical portion of the under surface of the fore-wings being nearly always protectively
  coloured, these being portions of the wings exposed to view when the insect is at rest. There is
  an unusual amount of ornamental colouring on the upper surface. The flight is invariably diurnal.
  The larva has ten prolegs.</p>

  <p>This handsome insect has occurred from time to time at various localities in both the North and
  the South Islands, but does not appear to be generally common. Particulars of the early captures
  of this butterfly are thus given by Mr. Enys<a id="NtA_44" href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>:
  "First recorded as a New Zealand insect by Mr. Fereday, in a paper read before the Canterbury
  Institute, January 2, 1874, and printed in vol. vi. of 'Transactions.' Mr. Fereday received the
  butterfly from F. H. Meinertzhagen, of Hawkes Bay. Dr. Hector also obtained it in Westland. It has
  also been caught near Auckland. In vol. xi. of  'Transactions' Mr. F. W. Sturm records that he
  first saw this insect, or a closely allied one, at the Reinga, up the Wairoa River, Hawkes Bay,
  December, 1840, or January, 1841. In 1848 he captured a number at the Waiau, a tributary to that
  river. Again in 1861 he captured three on the Rangitikei River near Mr. Birch's run. He also
  records other captures." From these records it will be seen that the insect was observed as early
  as 1840, and it thus seems scarcely probable that it was accidentally introduced by man, as Mr.
  Butler appears to suppose.<a id="NtA_45" href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> Recently <i>A.
  erippus</i> has occurred many times in the neighbourhood of Cook's Straits. In 1879 several
  specimens were bred from larvæ found by Mr. C. W. Lee near Wangaehu. In 1881 I captured two
  specimens near Nelson and saw three others. In 1890 two specimens were taken by Mr. R. I.
  Kingsley, and in January of the following year I captured two more, all near Nelson. During the
  autumn of 1892 <span class="pagenum" id="page103">{103}</span>one specimen was taken near Otaki by
  Mr. Rutherfurd, and several others were seen. The same year a specimen was also taken by Sir James
  Hector at Petone. In 1896, I understand from Mr. Kingsley, several specimens were again seen in
  the Nelson district.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is from 3¾ to 4¼ inches. Above, all the wings are rich
    orange-brown bordered with black, the veins are also black. There are two rows of small white
    spots round the margins of all the wings, and several orange-brown spots near the apex of the
    fore-wings. Beneath, the markings are similar, except that the white spots are larger, and the
    hind-wings are very pale yellowish-brown. The male has a black chitinous spot on vein 2 of the
    hind-wings which is wanting in the female; the wing-veins in the male are also slightly
    narrower.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The larva of this insect feeds on most of the different kinds of milkweed (<i>Asclepias</i>),
  and also upon dogbane (<i>Apocynum</i>). A single caterpillar, fully grown, which was found in a
  building in the centre of the town of Wellington, formed the subject from which the figures of the
  metamorphosis of this insect were taken, but this specimen did not afford sufficient material for
  an exhaustive investigation of the life-history. The following account, taken from Professor
  Riley's 'Third Annual Report of the Noxious, Beneficial, and other Insects of the State of
  Missouri,' is therefore inserted<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p>"The egg is invariably deposited on the under side of a leaf, and is conical and delicately
    reticulate with longitudinal ribs, and fine transverse striæ. It is yellowish when first
    deposited, but becomes grey as the embryo within develops.</p>
    <p>"In about five days after laying the egg hatches, and the young larva as soon as hatched
    usually turns round and devours its egg-shell&mdash;a custom very prevalent with young
    caterpillars. At this stage it differs considerably from the mature larva; it is perfectly
    cylindrical, about 0·12 inch long, and of much the same thickness throughout. The head is jet
    black and polished; the colour of the body is pale greenish-white, with the anterior and
    posterior horns showing as mere black conical joints, and with two transverse-oval black warts,
    nearer together, on the first joint. It is covered with minute black bristles, arising from
    still more minute warts.</p>
    <p class="sp0">"When the young larva is three or four days old a dusky band appears across the
    middle of each joint, and by the fifth or sixth day it spins a carpet of silk upon the leaf, and
    prepares for its first moult. After the first moult the anterior horns are as long as the
    thoracic legs, the posterior ones being somewhat shorter; the characteristic black stripes show
    quite distinctly, but the white and yellow stripes more faintly. After this it undergoes but
    slight change in appearance, except that the colours become brighter, and that at each
    successive moult the horns become relatively longer. There are but three moults, and the
    intervals between them are short, as the larvæ frequently acquire their full growth within three
    weeks from hatching.</p>
  </div>

  <p>"As soon as the larva is full grown it spins a little tuft of silk to the under side of
  whatever object it may be resting upon, and after entangling the hooks of its hind legs in the
  silk it lets go the hold of its other legs and hangs down, with the head and anterior joints of
  the body curved. In this position it hangs for about twenty-four hours, during which the fluids of
  the body naturally gravitate towards the upturned joints, until the latter become so swollen that
  at last, by a little effort on the part of the larva, the skin bursts along the back behind the
  head. Through the rent thus made the anterior portion of the pupa is protruded, and by constant
  stretching and contracting the larval skin is slipped and crowded backwards until there is but a
  small shrivelled mass gathered around the tail. Now comes the critical period&mdash;the
  culminating point.</p>

  <p>"The soft and supple chrysalis, yet showing the elongate larval form with distinct traces of
  its prolegs, hangs heavily from the shrunken skin. From this skin <span class="pagenum"
  id="page104">{104}</span>it is to be extricated and firmly attached to the silk outside. It has
  neither legs nor arms, and we should suppose that it would inevitably fall while endeavouring to
  accomplish this object. But the task is performed with the utmost surety, though appearing so
  perilous to us. The supple and contractile joints of the abdomen are made to subserve the purpose
  of legs, and by suddenly grasping the shrunken larval skin between the folds of two of these
  joints as with a pair of pincers, the chrysalis disengages the tip of its body and hangs for a
  moment suspended. Then with a few earnest, vigorous, jerking movements it succeeds in sticking the
  horny point of its tail into the silk, and firmly fastening it by means of a rasp of minute claws
  with which that point is furnished. Sometimes severe effort is needed before the point is properly
  fastened, and the chrysalis frequently has to climb by stretching the two joints above those by
  which it is suspended, and clinging hold of the shrivelled skin further up. The moment the point
  is fastened the chrysalis commences, by a series of violent jerkings and whirlings, to dislodge
  the larval skin, after which it rests from its efforts and gradually contracts and hardens. The
  really active work lasts but a few minutes, and the insect rarely fails to go through with it
  successfully. The chrysalis is a beautiful object, and as it hangs pendant from some old
  fence-board or from the under side of an <i>Asclepias</i> leaf, it reminds one of some large
  eardrop; but, though the jeweller could successfully imitate the form, he might well despair of
  ever producing the clear pale-green and the ivory-black and golden marks which so characterize
  it.</p>

  <p>"The chrysalis state lasts but a short time, as is the case with all those which are known to
  suspend themselves nakedly by the tail. At the end of about the tenth day the dark colours of the
  future butterflies begin to show through the delicate and transparent skin, and suddenly this skin
  bursts open near the head, and the newborn butterfly gradually extricates itself, and stretching
  forth its legs and clambering on to some surrounding object, allows its moist, thickened, and
  contracted wings to hang listlessly from the body."</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears in March and April, hibernated specimens being met with
  in the spring. It is a most striking species on the wing, and one which, when once seen, is not
  likely to be forgotten.</p>

  <p>This fine species appears to be rare in New Zealand, but I think it has now occurred often
  enough to entitle it to a place amongst our native butterflies. The following is a list of the
  captures so far as I am able to ascertain them<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>From Mr. Eny's 'Catalogue of New Zealand Butterflies'<a id="NtA_46"
  href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> the first specimen taken appears to have been a male, which was
  captured by Dr. Sinclair, of Auckland, and sent to the British Museum before the year 1855. The
  Rev. Richard Taylor also caught  one male specimen in his garden at Wanganui, and saw another, the
  only <span class="pagenum" id="page105">{105}</span>two he observed in thirty-four years. Dr.
  Baker saw one in his garden at Christchurch on lilac flowers, also a male. Mr. R. W. Fereday<a
  id="NtA_47" href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> records the capture of the first female specimen by
  a son of Mr. Thomas Tanner, near Napier, in January, 1876. On the 18th of March, 1885, Mr. R. I.
  Kingsley<a id="NtA_48" href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> took a fine female specimen in Nelson,
  and on the 25th of March, 1886, I saw another female specimen in the same locality; I also
  understand that quite a number of specimens of both sexes have been recently captured in the
  neighbourhood of Auckland.<a id="NtA_49" href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

  <p>From the foregoing records, I think that there are very good reasons for regarding this as an
  indigenous species, as it is very improbable that such a large number of specimens would have been
  accidentally introduced to the various localities at so many different times.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings of the male is 3½ inches, of the female 4 inches. On
    the upper side all the wings of the male are rich brownish-black, with a large white blotch in
    the middle of each, surrounded by a patch of brilliant flashing blue; there is also a small
    white spot near the apex of the fore-wings and a series of white crescent-shaped markings on the
    termen of all the wings. The fore-wings of the female are brownish-black, with a patch of deep
    orange-brown near the tornus; there is a series of four very large oval white spots on the
    costa, beyond the middle, a smaller white spot near the apex, and three rows of small white
    marks parallel to the termen; the hind-wings are brownish-black, with a broad white band across
    the middle, several small white spots, and a double series of white markings parallel to the
    termen; all the wings of the female have brilliant bluish reflections near the white spots. On
    the under side the wings of both sexes are rich brown with white markings, and a double series
    of white crescents on the termen.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The female appears to be very variable in almost every respect.</p>

  <p>The perfect insect appears in January, February and March. From its large size and brilliant
  colouring it is easily recognised. Although rare in New Zealand, it is very common in Australia.
  It also occurs in Java, New Guinea and the Loyalty Islands. A smaller representative is found in
  Samoa (<i>Anosia otaheitæ</i>, Feld.), which is probably only a variety of this species.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The figures and descriptions of this insect are taken from Australian specimens,

  <p>This handsome insect is the most familiar of New Zealand butterflies. It is very common and
  generally distributed throughout the country.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page106">{106}</span></div>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p>The expansion of the wings varies from 2&#x215C; to 2¾ inches. Above, all the wings are
    black, becoming bronzy towards the body. <i>The fore-wings have a band of dark red nearly across
    the middle, and a series of three small blue spots, and three larger white spots near the apex.
    The hind-wings have a broad dark red band near the termen, containing two pairs of black spots
    with blue centres.</i> On the under side the fore-wings are dark brown, with a broad patch of
    red in the middle, and a very conspicuous eye-like mark on the costa, consisting of a black
    central spot surrounded by a blue ring, and encircled by a yellow crescent towards the termen.
    The hind-wings are brownish-grey, with many darker and paler markings; the four spots on the
    upper surface are faintly indicated on the under side by blackish rings and central dots; the
    colouring of the under side varies a good deal. It is considerably darker and duller in some
    specimens than in others.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The egg, which is deposited on a nettle-leaf, is barrel-shaped, ornamented with a
    series of longitudinal ribs meeting in a central spot on the top. It is pale green, with the
    ribs white. The young larva, when first hatched, is dusky-yellow, with the spines black. In
    about a week it moults for the first time, and is then of an almost uniform brown, with the
    lateral lines faintly indicated. Ten days later it again sheds its skin, after which time the
    white lateral markings are considerably stronger. The full-grown larva varies from black to
    reddish-brown, with interrupted pale lateral and dorsal lines. On the third and fourth segments
    there are four spines, on the fifth to eleventh seven spines; the twelfth segment has six
    spines, and the thirteenth two spines. There are numerous white dots all over the larva. The
    spines vary from pale green to black. The caterpillar is considerably attenuated at each end,
    the central portions being somewhat swollen. Length about 1½ inches.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This caterpillar constructs for itself a small tent by fastening together several of the leaves
  of its food-plant. In this dwelling it can feed, safely concealed from all enemies. There are two
  kinds of nettles constituting the food of this insect&mdash;one a small plant, which generally
  grows in little patches amongst ferns in the forest (<i>Urtica incisa</i>), the other a large
  shrub or tree often found in rather open situations near rivers (<i>Urtica ferox</i>). The shrub
  is easily recognised by the formidable array of long, white spines which project from the midrib
  of each leaf. The larvæ of <i>V. gonerilla</i> are much more easily collected on the tree nettle
  than on the dwarf species; their leafy tents being easily detected by an examination of the
  foliage. When once discovered the larvæ are best obtained by cutting off, with a pair of strong
  scissors, the leaves which form their habitations. Like most larvæ of the genus <i>Vanessa</i>,
  these caterpillars are extremely voracious and soon eat themselves out of house and home. Those
  feeding on the tree nettle have an unlimited supply of leaves available both for food and shelter,
  but in the case of larvæ, which are dependent on the dwarf nettle for their supplies, no doubt
  individuals must occasionally die of starvation, as we sometimes observe large patches of the
  <i>Urtica incisa</i> completely destroyed by the larvæ of this butterfly. In some seasons these
  larvæ may be found as early as the middle of September, and continue abundant until the middle or
  end of January.</p>

  <p>When full grown, this caterpillar suspends itself by the tail to a little patch of silk, which
  it has spun on the under side of a leaf, having also drawn two or three other leaves around it in
  the same way as the feeding larva. In this situation it hangs, with the head and three anterior
  segments slightly curved upwards, for nearly twenty-four hours before the transformation to the
  pupa state occurs. I have often watched these larvæ changing, and as their man&#x0153;uvres during
  the process exactly resemble those of <i>Anosia erippus</i> a special description is unnecessary.
  The actual transformation may be easily observed in this species, as the larvæ are common and
  <span class="pagenum" id="page107">{107}</span>can be obtained in large numbers. It is well worth
  watching, and if a good many specimens are kept at once, some of them are sure to change at a
  convenient time for observation. The pupa varies from pale yellowish-brown to dark purplish-brown,
  darker on the wing-cases and ventral surface. The spines on the back are golden. The whole insect
  is also speckled with brown or black dots. The pupa varies considerably in size as well as in
  colour. In this insect the pupa state is of very short duration, usually only lasting about a
  fortnight. I am informed by Mr. Helms that the pupa of <i>Vanessa gonerilla</i> is often destroyed
  by the common hemipteron, <i>Cermatulus nasalis</i>, which penetrates its shell by means of its
  long rostrum, and speedily consumes the liquid internal portions.</p>

  <p>The perfect insect usually emerges early in the morning. It dries its wings for a few hours
  whilst resting on the old nettle-leaves which formed its home when a larva. The increasing warmth
  of the sunshine soon hardens the wings sufficiently to allow the new-born butterfly to fly
  away.</p>

  <p>This insect is very common in most situations from January till April. It lives through the
  winter, appearing again on fine days towards the end of August. During the spring and early summer
  these hibernated individuals occur in great profusion, a few specimens always remaining until the
  earliest of the new ones have emerged; so that about December we may occasionally observe both
  hibernated and recent specimens together.</p>

  <p>In the autumn these butterflies may be seen feeding on the flowers of the scabious and the
  white rata, thus preparing for their long winter sleep. In the spring, however, the insect is most
  abundant in the vicinity of the nettle-plants, where the females are busily engaged depositing
  their eggs.</p>

  <p>I have noticed that this insect possesses the power of emitting a distinct grating or hissing
  noise, evidently closely resembling the sound, which has been observed to be emitted by several
  European species of the genus.<a id="NtA_50" href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> This sound is only
  made when a specimen is roused from a semi-torpid condition; and it is thought that it may be
  useful to the insect for the purpose of intimidating intruders during its period of
  hibernation.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This butterfly is a rapid flier and may often be seen pursuing a straight course
  high above the tree-tops, apparently migrating in search of fresh breeding-grounds. It appears to
  have a singular liking for hill-tops, and a specimen which has selected one of these places will
  keep on returning to the same spot, after being repeatedly frightened away. In such situations, if
  the weather be calm and sunny, we may frequently see two specimens engaged in aerial battle. They
  fly upwards, and coursing round each other with great velocity, almost disappear in the clear blue
  sky. A few seconds later the two insects, gently fanning their wings in the warm sunshine, are
  again seen in their respective places.</p>

  <p>This beautiful butterfly is, I believe, fairly abundant in the northern portions of the North
  Island, but becomes scarcer southwards of Napier and New Plymouth. In the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page108">{108}</span>South Island I believe I once saw a specimen at Nelson, but beyond that I
  can find no record of its occurrence there.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 2 inches. The fore-wings are black, becoming
    reddish-brown speckled with gold towards the base; <i>there is a very broad yellow band nearly
    across the middle, and one yellow and two white spots near the apex</i>. The hind-wings are rich
    reddish-brown, broadly bordered with black, especially towards the costa; there are four small
    black spots with blue centres near the termen, and a blue stripe bordered with black at the
    tornus. The under surface closely resembles that of <i>Vanessa gonerilla</i>, except that the
    red patch on the fore-wings is replaced by pale yellow, and the markings on the hind-wings are
    more sharply defined.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The perfect insect appears from January till April, hibernated specimens occurring in the
  spring. It is very fond of selecting a perch on the top of a hill, and often engages in violent
  encounters with <i>Vanessa gonerilla</i>. During the contest both insects course round each other
  with great rapidity, and generally ascend to a considerable elevation. They almost invariably
  return to their former resting-places. This is a fortunate habit for the collector, as it
  frequently enables him to ultimately capture a specimen, which he has almost touched with the net
  on several previous occasions. I have noticed this propensity to return to a favourite perch in
  the European species of the genus <i>Vanessa</i>, so that it is most likely a congenital habit,
  probably of great antiquity.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This insect has a fine appearance when flying; the large yellow spots on the
  forewings are then very conspicuous, and ensure its immediate and certain recognition.</p>

  <p>This elegant butterfly occurs throughout both islands, but is very irregular in its appearance.
  In some years it is quite abundant, whilst in others scarcely a specimen will be seen. During the
  summer of 1889-1890 it was extremely plentiful in the Wellington district, being at that time much
  commoner than <i>Vanessa gonerilla</i>, but its appearance in such large numbers as this was, I
  think, very exceptional.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings varies from 2 to 2¼ inches. <i>Above, all the wings
    are orange-red, spotted and mottled with black.</i> The fore-wings are bronzy towards the base;
    <i>in the black apex there are five white spots</i>. Near the termen of the hind-wings three of
    the black spots have blue centres. On the under side of the fore-wings the markings are very
    similar to those on the upper side, except that there are several additional white blotches, and
    the orange-red ground colour has a rosy blush towards the base. The hind-wings are very
    beautifully mottled with an elaborate series of pale brown, purplish-grey, yellowish-brown, and
    white markings; three of the large spots near the termen have pale blue centres.</p>
  </div>

  <p>I have not yet met with the larva of this insect, neither can I find any record of its having
  been observed in New Zealand. The following description by Mr. Stainton is taken from a European
  specimen:<a id="NtA_51" href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> "The spiny larva is brown with two
  dorsal and two lateral yellow lines; on the third, fourth, and twelfth segments there are four
  spines; on the fifth to eleventh segments seven spines, and on the thirteenth two spines; it feeds
  solitarily in rolled thistle-leaves."</p>

  <p>The perfect insect appears in January, February, March and April, hibernated specimens
  occurring from August until December. It is a much more wary butterfly than either <i>Vanessa
  gonerilla</i> or <i>V. itea</i>, and can seldom be captured after it has once been <span
  class="pagenum" id="page109">{109}</span>disturbed, although it will often return to the same spot
  several times in succession. In fact, owing to its extreme timidity, its capture is generally
  attended with some difficulty.</p>

  <p>This insect is found almost throughout the entire world. In specimens from the Northern
  Hemisphere the black spots on the hind-wings have no blue centres, and the butterflies are a
  little larger than those found in the Southern Hemisphere, otherwise the two insects are exactly
  alike. The southern form has been called <i>V. kershawii</i> by several writers, but the
  differences do not appear to me to be sufficiently important to merit a distinct specific name,
  especially as both forms occur together in South Africa.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This insect has frequently been observed at various places on the European
  Continent migrating in vast swarms; and it seems probable that its strong migratory instinct may
  have led to its enormously wide range at the present time.</p>

  <p>This butterfly was very common in the neighbourhood of Wellington during the summer of 1886-87.
  To the best of my knowledge the insect had not previously been observed in New Zealand, but I
  understand from Mr. R. Holloway that he has since met with it on the sea-coast near New Plymouth,
  in 1893, and at Motueka in 1898.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is nearly 2 inches. On the upper side all the wings
    are dull blackish-brown, with greenish or bronzy reflections. The fore-wings have two broad
    orange-brown stripes on the costa, and <i>a very large patch of the same colour along the
    termen, containing a large black spot with a bluish-white centre</i>; there are three irregular
    whitish marks near the apex of the wing, and a minute blue-centred ocellus. The hind-wings have
    <i>two very large orange-brown spots almost touching each other near the termen; each of these
    contains a large blue-centred ocellus in the middle</i>; there are also two terminal rows of
    brown crescent-shaped markings. Underneath, the markings of the fore-wings resemble those of the
    upper side, but they are very much paler, and the ground colour is light brown. The hind-wings
    are pale brown, with a wavy black line across the middle, followed by a brown shading towards
    the termen; there are also four small round black spots and a series of irregular black dots
    near the termen.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The perfect insect occurred very plentifully in December, January and February, and was fond of
  settling on barren, stony places in the hot sunshine. It was very timid and difficult to catch,
  darting off with great rapidity when approached. During the season I managed to secure about nine
  specimens, some of them in very good condition. I am unable to explain the sudden appearance of
  this butterfly in New Zealand during the above-mentioned year. The large numbers, which were
  observed over extended areas, almost seem to forbid its accidental importation from Australia,
  whilst the distance of New Zealand from that continent would render immigration a most unlikely
  circumstance. On the other hand, if the insect is a regular inhabitant of this country, it is
  strange that it had never before been observed. When on the wing, its superficial resemblance to
  <i>Vanessa cardui</i> may have led to its having been overlooked, and hence it is very desirable
  that entomologists should use every effort to detect it in the future.</p>

  <p class="sp3">According to Mr. Olliff, this butterfly has a very wide geographical range, being
  <span class="pagenum" id="page110">{110}</span>found in Java, Sumatra, Tasmania and all parts of
  the Australian Continent. About the year 1830 it was described by Stephens, in his 'British
  Entomology,' under the name of <i>Cynthia hampstediensis</i>, on account of its having been taken
  at Hampstead, the well-known suburb of London. Subsequently it transpired that the specimen in
  question was no doubt of foreign origin, its "appearance" having been due to a practical joke
  perpetrated on the British Lepidopterists of the day.</p>

  <p>This species occurs commonly on the tussock lands from Christchurch to Invercargill. In the
  provinces of Nelson and Marlborough it is, I believe, confined to situations having elevations of
  from 2,000 to 4,000 feet above the sea-level. It has never been captured in the North Island.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings varies from 1&#x215C; to 1¾ inches. <i>Above, all the
    wings are dull brownish-black, paler near the body; the outer portion of each is covered with a
    large patch of bright orange-brown (northern form), or fawn colour (southern form); on the
    fore-wings this patch contains a large oval black spot, with two white dots in the middle; on
    the hind-wings there are two, three, or four black spots, with one white dot in the centre of
    each</i>; beneath, the markings on the fore-wings resemble those of the upper surface, except
    that there are often several short silvery stripes near the apex; the hind-wings are dull
    yellow, with silver streaks between the veins, and one broader streak in the centre of the wing.
    The female is much paler than the male, with the borders of the wings whitish.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This insect is extremely variable. The colouring appears to be much influenced by local
  conditions. On the Dun Mountain, Nelson district, at an elevation of about 2,700 feet, a very
  small light form occurs in which the sexes are almost exactly alike. There are only two perfect
  spots on the upper surface of the hind-wings; the other spot is <span class="pagenum"
  id="page111">{111}</span>rudimentary, and has no white central dot. On the under side there are no
  silver stripes near the apex of the fore-wings, and only five or six silver stripes on the
  marginal portions of the hind-wings (see Plate <a href="#plate11">XI</a>., figs. 3 and 7). At
  Kekerangu, on the "Chalk Range," at an elevation of from 3,000 to 4,000 feet, a similar but
  slightly larger form occurs. On the Tableland of Mount Arthur, Nelson district, 3,600 to 4,600
  feet above the sea-level, the females are paler than in either of the preceding forms, and the
  males darker, so that the sexes are well marked; but there are no silvery stripes on the under
  side of the apex of the fore-wings, and usually only five stripes on the marginal portions of the
  hind-wings. Finally, in the Canterbury, Otago and Southland butterflies (southern form), we have
  the large, very dark reddish-brown coloured male insect with large ocelli, and the extremely pale
  yellow female with small ocelli, the two sexes here exhibiting the greatest differentiation. On
  the under side, the male has several small silver stripes near the apex of the fore-wings, and
  seven stripes on the marginal portions of the hind-wings. (See Plate <a href="#plate11">XI</a>.,
  figs. 4, 5, and 6.) In elevated situations in Canterbury, however, I have taken a somewhat similar
  variety to that found on the Mount Arthur Tableland. I have also taken similar forms on Mount
  Robert near Lake Rotoiti, Nelson district, these having, in addition, numerous white hairs on the
  wings near the body.</p>

  <p>Besides these extreme variations, which appear to be largely dependent on local conditions,
  great variability exists with respect to the number and size of the ocelli or white-centred spots.
  In some specimens there are no ocelli on the hind-wings; in others, two, three, or four very
  minute ones, whilst others have all four very large. Occasionally specimens have a minute ocellus
  below the large one on the fore-wings. Were it not for the intermediate varieties, there would
  probably be little hesitation in separating the extreme forms of this insect into several distinct
  species; but as they are connected by a host of intermediate forms, it is quite impossible even to
  divide them into varieties.</p>

  <p>In a paper communicated to the 'Entomologist' in February, 1889,<a id="NtA_52"
  href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> by Mr. W. W. Smith, the author makes some interesting remarks on
  the variation of this butterfly, as observed by him in Canterbury and Otago. After pointing out
  the great diversity exhibited by different specimens in the depth of colouring, and in the number
  and size of the ocelli, he states that in his opinion the greatest variation occurs during the
  summers that succeed wet winters. In the year 1888 I had the opportunity of inspecting a most
  interesting series of this insect, presented by Mr. Smith to the Wellington Museum. They embraced
  specimens of very varied colouring, and included, amongst other remarkable forms, a male, which
  was entirely destitute of all ocelli, both on the fore- and on the hind-wings. Amongst these
  specimens, however, I did not see any resembling those I have described from Nelson and
  Marlborough. This collection has, I regret to say, since been disposed of by the Museum
  authorities, and cannot therefore be utilised by New Zealand students.</p>

  <p>The larva of this insect feeds on the tussock grass (<i>Poa australis</i>). Its length, when
  full grown, is about 1 inch. The top of the head is furnished with a very large process, which
  projects forwards. The body is much attenuated towards the tail, which is bifid. The general
  colour is dull green, with a crimson line on each side and numerous alternate lines of yellow and
  white. The legs and prolegs are very small. There are four wrinkles on the posterior edges of each
  segment.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page112">{112}</span></div>

  <p>When feeding, this caterpillar rests on a blade of the tussock, where it is very inconspicuous.
  It appears to prefer the dead or drier portions of the grass, and feeds and grows very slowly. It
  is strictly diurnal in its habits, relapsing into a death-like repose at night.</p>

  <p>The pupa is suspended by the tail to an upright blade of the tussock. In the specimen I reared,
  I was fortunate enough to witness the actual transformation, and during the process, observed it
  seizing hold of the larval skin with its posterior segments, its man&#x0153;uvres whilst thus
  engaged exactly resembling those of the pupa of <i>Anosia erippus</i>, described above by
  Professor Riley.</p>

  <p>The length of the pupa is about ½ inch. Its colour is bright green, with a reddish line along
  the edge of each wing-case, and several white lines on the sides and back.</p>

  <p>The perfect insect appears from December till the end of March. It is usually very abundant
  where found, the males being more numerous than the females in the proportion of about five to
  one. It flies amongst the tussock grass in a weak and aimless manner. When rapidly pursued it has
  a habit of plunging into a tussock and closing its wings, where it remains quite invisible until
  the danger is past.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The silver stripes on the under side of the hind-wings are very protective to the
  insect when at rest on its food-plant, the striped coloration of the larva and pupa no doubt
  serving similar protective purposes.</p>

  <p>A single specimen of this interesting butterfly was discovered by Mr. R. Helms, in 1881, on the
  Paparoa Range, near Greymouth, at an elevation of about 1,500 feet above the sea-level. Until
  within the last three years only three other specimens had been captured, viz., one near
  Wainui-o-mata, in Mr. A. P. Buller's collection; one on the Dun Mountain, Nelson, at an elevation
  of about 2,500 feet, which is in my collection; and one on the Tableland of Mount Arthur, at about
  3,300 feet, which was kindly given to me by Mr. C. W. Palmer. In the summer of 1894-95 several
  specimens were captured by Mr. P. Marshall near Wanganui,<a id="NtA_53"
  href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> and during the same season Messrs. Smithers and Hawthorne
  discovered the insect in considerable abundance at a locality near Silverstream, in the Wellington
  district. During the two following summers additional specimens were obtained near Silverstream,
  and I was fortunate enough to discover there a number of specimens of the larva, which furnished
  the material for the illustration and description of the preparatory stages of the insect given in
  this work.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 2 inches. <i>On the upper side all the wings
    are dark brown. The fore-wings have two broad bands of yellowish-orange, the outer one
    containing a <span class="pagenum" id="page113">{113}</span>small patch of dark brown near the
    costa, which touches a white-centred black ocellus. The hind-wings have one large patch of
    yellowish-orange containing two ocelli; a large ocellus, surrounded by a broad ring of
    reddish-orange, is situated on the tornus</i>; the tornus is produced into two very broad but
    short tails, which are bordered with white cilia. On the under side the fore-wings are light
    ochreous-yellow; there is a shaded brown patch at the base; the termen is broadly bordered with
    brown, the border containing a silver streak; two broad brown patches are situated on the costa,
    the outer one terminated by a small ocellus, and enclosing a silvery patch near the apex of the
    wing. <i>The hind-wings are silvery, narrowly bordered with deep reddish-brown, with five deep
    reddish-brown stripes running from the costa towards the tornus</i>; the fourth stripe from the
    base of the wing contains three ocelli surrounded by yellow rings; a conspicuous ocellus is
    situated at the tornus, surrounded by a broad orange-red ring.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This insect appears to vary a little in the extent of the yellowish-orange colouring of the
  upper side. It also varies in size, specimens from the North Island being slightly larger than
  those from the South Island.</p>

  <p>The larva feeds on a species of sedge (<i>Galinia setifolia</i>), which always grows abundantly
  in the birch forests, where the butterflies are found. When full grown the length of this
  caterpillar is about 1¼ inches. Its body is much attenuated at each end and rather stout in the
  middle; the head and tail are bifid; there are numerous straight, shallow, transverse wrinkles on
  each segment, especially towards the head. The colour is green, with a number of fine, paler and
  darker green, dorsal and lateral lines; the head and thirteenth segment are yellowish. The legs
  are very minute, and the prolegs of moderate size. It is extremely susceptible to the attacks of a
  Dipterous parasite. In fact, out of thirty larvæ kept by Mr. Hawthorne and myself, no less than 75
  per cent. were thus destroyed. This larva feeds on the leaves of the sedge, eating out long
  notches parallel to the veins of the leaf. These notches are the best guides to follow in
  searching for the larva, as the colouring of the caterpillar renders its discovery amongst the
  food-plant extremely difficult. The larvæ should be looked for during the end of December or the
  beginning of January.</p>

  <p>The pupa is rather stout, light green, with the edge of the wing-case and the prominences
  formed by the back and palpi, edged with crimson and white. It is suspended by the tail to any
  firm object in the neighbourhood of the sedge.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect appears in February. It frequents sunny glades in the birch
  forest, usually at considerable elevations above the sea-level. Mr. Helms informs me that he has
  seen specimens near Greymouth in October, and hence concludes that there are two broods in the
  year. The butterfly is very difficult to capture, as it has a most provoking habit of resting on
  the foliage of the birch-trees, just out of the collector's reach. I am unable to explain the
  object of the remarkable colouring of the under side of this insect, but it is probably
  protective, although in what way has yet to be discovered.</p>

  <p>This fine butterfly has occurred plentifully on many mountain-tops in the South Island, from
  Nelson to Lake Wakatipu. It has never been observed in the North Island.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings of the male is 1¾ inches, of the female 2 inches.
    <i>On the upper side all the wings are a very rich bronzy-black. The fore-wings have a paler
    patch near the apex, containing two small, and three large black ocelli with white centres</i>;
    these ocelli are usually joined together. On the under side all the wings are considerably paler
    and greyer. The hind-wings have a series of pale spots near the termen, and a paler shade across
    the middle.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The insect varies chiefly in the number of ocelli. On the upper side of the fore-wings there
  are sometimes only four, the minute ocellus on the costa being absent, whilst occasionally a small
  extra ocellus appears below the normal series. On the under side this last-mentioned ocellus is
  very frequently, but not invariably, present. In some female specimens an extremely minute ocellus
  may be detected on the upper surface of the hind-wings near the termen. On the under side of the
  hind-wings in both sexes the series of pale terminal spots are often absent, and the general depth
  of the colouring varies considerably.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fereday has described and figured a very interesting variation occurring in the structure
  of the costal veins of this species,<a id="NtA_54" href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> vein 11 of
  the fore-wings sometimes running into 12 (see Plate <a href="#plate1">I</a>., fig. 26), and
  sometimes being entirely absent (fig. 25). After reading Mr. Fereday's article I examined the
  specimens in my own collection, and found that all those taken on Mount Arthur and on Mount Peel,
  in the Nelson district, had veins 11 and 12 joined, whilst the two specimens I took on Mount Enys,
  Castle Hill, West Coast Road, had vein 11 absent. As, however, Mr. Fereday has specimens
  exhibiting both forms of neuration, from Castle Hill and from Mount Hutt, I do not think it likely
  that the peculiarity is confined to butterflies from any particular locality. Like Mr. Fereday, I
  have observed that the specimens having veins 11 and 12 joined, are smaller than those having vein
  11 absent.</p>

  <p>The perfect insect appears in January, February and March. It frequents shingle slopes on
  mountains, at elevations ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 feet above the sea-level. Sometimes the
  butterflies occur in considerable numbers, flying in a lazy, aimless manner in the scorching
  sunshine, but instantly retreating into crevices between the stones when the sun is obscured. I
  have observed that this species is most abundant in the neighbourhood of the carpet grass, on
  which I fully anticipate its larva feeds. It seldom, however, settles on this grass, preferring to
  alight on the shingle, which, owing to the rarefied air existing at such high elevations, soon
  becomes intensely heated by the sun's rays.</p>

  <p class="sp3">When disturbed this insect flies with considerable rapidity and thus often eludes
  the net, so that the capture of a good series of specimens on a rugged mountain-top is usually
  very exciting, if not actually dangerous work. As with many other <span class="pagenum"
  id="page115">{115}</span>insects, mountain ranges are more prolific in this butterfly than
  isolated peaks. Mount Peel, situated to the west of Mount Arthur, is the best locality I know of
  for this and many other Alpine species. Its gentle slopes enable the collector to work with
  perfect ease and safety, whilst the patches of rich soil occurring nearly to the top of the
  mountain support an unusually varied Alpine flora of great interest.</p>

  <p>This interesting butterfly was described from three dilapidated specimens captured by Mr. J. D.
  Enys at Whitcombe's Pass, Canterbury, on March 8, 1879, at about 4,000 feet above the sea-level.
  From that time I believe no other specimens had been found until January, 1894, when I took quite
  a large number on the Humboldt Range, at the head of Lake Wakatipu, at elevations ranging from
  4,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea-level.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings of the male is 1&#x215D; inches, of the female 1½
    inches. <i>On the upper side all the wings of the male are smoky-brown; the fore-wings have a
    large black ocellus near the apex, enclosing two white dots, followed by a smaller ocellus
    towards the dorsum; the hind-wings have three black spots near the termen, sometimes enclosing
    white dots.</i> Occasionally these ocelli are surrounded by a patch of deep reddish-brown. The
    female is much paler, with large patches of yellowish-brown surrounding the ocelli. On the under
    side the fore-wings of the male are smoky-brown, with an irregular blotch of reddish-brown near
    the apex, surrounding a small white-centred black ocellus. <i>The hind-wings are dark
    reddish-brown, with several conspicuous black-edged silvery markings, and four yellowish-red
    spots near the termen.</i> The under side of the female is very much paler.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This butterfly varies considerably on the upper side in the number and size of the ocelli, and
  in the extent of the reddish-brown markings which surround them; on the under side the silvery
  spots on the hind-wings are also variable.</p>

  <p>The perfect insect has been taken in January and March. It evidently frequents mountains in the
  South Island, at elevations of about 4,000 feet, but does not appear to be generally distributed
  in such localities. It seldom settles on the shingle, mostly resting on the snow grass, on which
  its larva probably feeds. It is a smaller insect than <i>E. pluto</i>, and flies much more feebly.
  These characteristics will at once enable the collector to distinguish it from <i>E. pluto</i>
  when on the wing.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Immediately a cloud obscures the sun these butterflies retreat into the tufts of
  the snow grass, remaining closely hidden there until the sun shines out again. This circumstance
  makes the capture of the insect, even in a favourable locality, a matter of considerable
  uncertainty, as bright sunshine is more often the exception than the rule on the summits of high
  mountains.</p>

  <p>This pretty little butterfly appears to be very common in most parts of New Zealand. I have
  records of its occurrence in abundance at various localities, from Napier southwards to
  Invercargill.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings varies from 1 to 1½ inches. <i>On the upper side all
    the wings are brilliant shining copper, with black markings.</i> Fore-wings with three spots
    near the middle, then a row of black spots, often forming a band nearly parallel with the
    termen, another row on the termen, generally touching the narrow black border of the wing.
    Hind-wings resembling fore-wings, except that there is only one elongate spot in the centre, and
    the terminal series of spots is nearly always separated from the black border. In the female the
    black spots are united and form bands, those on the termen often having violet or blue centres.
    The veins in both sexes are indicated by black lines, which are often double in the male, when
    the vein itself is coppery. On the under side the fore-wings are orange-brown, bordered with
    yellow; the spots resemble those of the upper side, except that the terminal series are
    generally faint or obsolete towards the costa. The hind-wings vary from light yellow to dull
    brown; the spots are dull greyish, the posterior series often having white centres.</p>
  </div>

  <p>From the foregoing it may be seen that the variation in this insect is considerable. After a
  careful examination of a large number of specimens taken at various localities in both North and
  South Islands, I am, however, unable to find characters of sufficient constancy to entitle any of
  the forms to specific rank. The most striking of these varieties appears to be that described by
  Mr. Bates as <i>Chrysophanus feredayi</i>.<a id="NtA_55" href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> (See
  Plate <a href="#plate13">XIII</a>., fig. 2, upper side; Plate <a href="#plate12">XII</a>., fig.
  21, under side.) On the upper surface it has the central series of spots almost forming a band in
  the male, and the coppery ground colour is paler than in the typical form. On the under side the
  borders of the fore-wings, and the whole of the hind-wings are dull brown. This form closely
  resembles <i>C. rauparaha</i>, Fereday.<a id="NtA_56" href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> <i>C.
  maui</i>, Fereday, is evidently that variety of the male having the veins bordered with two fine
  black lines. Mr. Fereday states that he has never been able to find the female of his <i>C.
  maui</i>. This is readily accounted for by the fact, that the female of <i>C. maui</i> is nothing
  more than the female of <i>C. salustius</i>.</p>

  <p>Recently two very remarkable aberrations of <i>C. salustius</i> have come under my <span
  class="pagenum" id="page117">{117}</span>notice; one captured by Mr. Hawthorne at Karori, in which
  the hind-wings are almost entirely suffused with blackish-brown, excepting a small patch of copper
  colour near the centre, and two patches on the termen. Another specimen, taken by Mr. Grapes near
  Paraparaumu, has the fore-wings also suffused with blackish-brown, except near the middle, where
  there are five coppery patches between the veins. On the under side there are six large oblong
  spots near the termen of the fore-wings, and a series of dusky oblong spots on the hind-wings.
  (See Plate <a href="#plate13">XIII</a>., fig. 3, fig. 4 under side.) Plate <a
  href="#plate13">XIII</a>., fig. 5, represents another variety discovered by Mr. Grapes on the
  coast near Paikakariki, in the Wellington district. It is remarkable for the bright blue terminal
  spots which are present in both sexes.</p>

  <p>The eggs of <i>C. salustius</i>, when first deposited, are pale green with yellow
  reticulations, the whole egg having a honeycombed appearance when magnified. They become uniform
  pale yellow before hatching. The young larva is shaped somewhat like a wood-louse. The head is
  quite hidden by the three anterior segments, which are much larger than the rest. After the first
  moult the larva becomes bright green, with a crimson line down the back; the head is then larger,
  and the three anterior segments considerably reduced. Unfortunately the life-history could not be
  investigated beyond this point, as the larvæ all died. The time of year when this occurred was
  late autumn, and it therefore seems probable that the larvæ hibernate and undergo their
  transformation early the following spring.</p>

  <p>The perfect insect first appears in November and continues abundant until the middle or end of
  February. Specimens of what I believe to be a second brood may be taken in March and April if the
  weather be fine, but in stormy seasons these are frequently not observed. I have also noticed that
  the autumnal specimens are usually smaller and paler in colour than those captured in the
  spring.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This butterfly frequents open situations, and in fine, sunny weather it is often
  very common.</p>

  <p>This species is tolerably common in the Wellington district, and I expect it will be found to
  occur in most localities in the North Island. I have also taken the insect at Nelson, but have not
  heard of its capture elsewhere in the South Island.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings varies from 1 to 1¼ inches. On the upper surface both
    sexes resemble some of the females of <i>Chrysophanus salustius</i>, except that the dark
    markings are very much broader, and the coppery colour is paler and less lustrous. On the under
    side the fore-wings are pale yellowish-brown, bordered with darker brown, with three black spots
    near the middle, and a chain of black spots beyond the middle. <i>The hind-wings are yellow,
    with a very large irregular patch of purplish brown extending over the costal and terminal
    portions.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>This insect varies chiefly in the extent of the dark markings on the upper side, which
  sometimes very much encroach on the golden ground colour. The spaces between veins 2, 3, and 4,
  near their origin are sometimes yellow and sometimes black, but, as every intermediate form
  exists, cannot be distinguished as species. Mr. Fereday regards the form with the black spaces as
  <i>C. feredayi</i>, Bates. As previously stated, however, I am inclined to think that <i>C.
  feredayi</i>, Bates, is the same form as <i>C. rauparaha</i>, Fereday.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page118">{118}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">This butterfly is essentially a forest-loving species, and may sometimes be taken
  quite plentifully in sunny openings on fine days, during December and January. It is not nearly so
  common as <i>C. salustius</i>, and I do not think that there is more than a single brood in a
  season.</p>

  <p>This brilliant little butterfly is very common in most localities in the South Island. In the
  North Island it has occurred at Lakes Wairarapa and Taupo.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is &#x215E; inch. On the upper side the male has all
    the wings brown, <i>tinged with the most brilliant glistening purple</i>. The fore-wings have
    two or three black spots near the middle, a curved series beyond the middle, and on the termen.
    The hind-wings have two black spots near the middle, a series beyond the middle, and a terminal
    series, generally with blue centres. All the wings are narrowly bordered with black. The female
    is pale yellowish-brown, the spots resemble those of the male, except that all the marginal
    series have bright purple or blue centres. On the under side the fore-wings of both sexes are
    pale yellow, bordered with slaty-blue: the spots are the same as on the upper side. The
    hind-wings are brownish-grey in male, slaty-grey in female, with the basal portion darker, and
    the spots of the upper side always indicated.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This insect is extremely variable, but I do not think it likely that any of the numerous forms
  will prove sufficiently constant to be regarded as distinct species. The male varies in the size
  and number of the black spots, many of which are often absent; in the extent of the purple sheen
  which is sometimes absent from the hind-wings, sometimes partially absent from the fore-wings, and
  sometimes extends over the whole of both pairs of wings; also in the colour of such sheen, which
  often inclines towards blue. Some specimens are much paler than others, and so far as my
  experience goes, these are chiefly found at considerable elevations; in such specimens, the ground
  colouring inclines towards yellow or orange, and the purple sheen is very brilliant, and extends
  over the whole of the wings. The female of this form is proportionately paler. Other specimens
  have the hind-wings almost black with no purple sheen, whilst in others the purple sheen remains.
  Another form has the usual markings, but the hind-wings are deep orange-brown, without purple
  sheen, which is also absent from the outer portions of the fore-wings. One female in my collection
  is dull brown, with yellow markings between the two rows of black spots. The under side is still
  more variable. One very striking form has only the basal portions of the fore-wings yellow, the
  rest of the ground colour is pale bluish-grey, and the spots black. On the hind-wings there are a
  number of black spots near the base; then an irregular band of black, and then a double row of
  marginal spots. An almost unlimited number of varieties appears to connect this form with one, in
  which all the markings on the hind-wings are nearly obsolete. The specimens of this insect taken
  in each district appear to exhibit differences from those taken elsewhere, but specimens also
  differ from the same district, so that at present we are unable to detect any well-marked local
  variation, or topomorphism, as it has been termed. It is consequently highly desirable that
  collectors should endeavour to obtain specimens from as many localities as possible, so that the
  nature of the variation of this butterfly may be better understood.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fereday states<a id="NtA_57" href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> that after carefully
  examining a patch of <i>Donatia <span class="pagenum" id="page119">{119}</span>novæzealandiæ</i>,
  a plant he had noticed much frequented by this butterfly, he succeeded in finding a larva which
  there could be little doubt would have given rise to this insect, had it lived. The following is
  taken from his description: The caterpillar is shaped like a wood-louse, hairy, and pale green.
  There is a series of conical purplish spots down the back, edged first with white, and then with
  dull red. On the sides there is a series of pale pinkish oblique stripes, blended with dull red
  towards the spiracles.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The perfect insect is very common in dry, stony places, generally near river-beds,
  during January, February and March. It flies only a short distance when disturbed, but is very
  quick on the wing, and hence difficult to catch until one becomes accustomed to it. In some places
  these little butterflies are so abundant that they take wing like a swarm of blow-flies. They
  seldom open their wings whilst at rest, so that when perched on the ground they are very
  inconspicuous.</p>

  <p>This little butterfly is extremely abundant in the neighbourhood of Nelson. I have also taken

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings of the male is 1 inch, of the female &#x215E; inch. On

    fore-wings, and two rows of similar spots near the termen. The hind-wings have several very

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">On the upper side this species can only be distinguished from the preceding by
    its somewhat brighter colour, and by the cilia which are more sharply barred with brown. <i>On
    the under side the whole of the fore-wings, and the central portions of the hind-wings between
    the outer and inner series of spots, are much darker and browner than in L. ph&#x0153;be</i>;
    the spots themselves are also considerably darker, and the central series of the hind-wings is
    almost black. A careful examination, however, shows that the markings are practically identical
    in both species, although of different degrees of <span class="pagenum"
    id="page120">{120}</span>intensity. In view of the great variability, which many species of this
    genus are known to exhibit in other countries, I am inclined to think that this butterfly's
    claim to specific distinction is a very slender one.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The following species are recorded by various observers as having occurred in New

    various parts of the insect. Its length is about 1 inch.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The eggs of this species are deposited inside the old case, which the female insect never
  leaves during the whole of her life. The young larva when first hatched is about &#x215B; inch in
  length. Its head and three anterior segments are corneous and much larger than the others, which
  are rather soft with the exception of the last one. These little <span class="pagenum"
  id="page124">{124}</span>larvæ are extremely active, and immediately after hatching leave the old
  case, and roam in all directions over the tree, letting themselves down from branch to branch by
  silken threads. They carry the posterior portion of their body elevated in the air, walking whilst
  doing so by means of their strong thoracic legs.</p>

  <p>The food-plants of this species are numerous. The following are a few of them: Manuka
  (<i>Leptospermum scoparium</i> and <i>ericoides</i>, <i>Cupressus macrocarpa</i>, <i>Pinus
  insignis</i>), and various species of willow, &amp;c. These, it will be observed, include several
  introduced trees. In fact, the insect is a very general feeder. About three days after leaving the
  egg, the little caterpillar constructs a minute, conical-shaped, silken case, which it carries
  almost in an upright position on its posterior segments. Later on in life this case becomes too
  heavy to be held vertically, and is afterwards dragged along by the larva, and often allowed to
  hang downwards. The case has two apertures&mdash;a large one in front, through which the head of
  the larva is projected, and a smaller one at the posterior extremity, which allows the pellets of
  excrement to fall out of the case, as soon as they are evacuated.</p>

  <p>Owing to the apterous and completely helpless condition of the female imago, it is evident that
  the dispersal of this insect must take place in the larval state. Distribution is of course quite
  impossible without a female being transported in some way, and from observations made on a good
  many larvæ of various ages, I am disposed to think that the migration of this insect to new
  localities takes place at an early age, possibly soon after its emergence from the egg. On this
  account I think that the occurrence of the moth in both North and South Islands is of great
  interest, as it would seem to indicate the existence of some connection between the two islands,
  at a period not sufficiently remote to have allowed any appreciable modification to take place in
  the insect's structure and habits. At the same time, it should be borne in mind, that the
  protection afforded the larva by its case, and its ability to feed on so many different plants,
  may have rendered any modification unnecessary for the preservation of the species during recent
  times. The length of the full-grown caterpillar is about 1 inch. The head is dull yellow speckled
  with black. The first three segments are very hard, dark brown, with numerous white markings. The
  remaining segments are considerably thickened near the middle of the insect, rudimentary prolegs
  being present on the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth segments of the larva. The anal prolegs are
  very strong, and are furnished with numerous sharp hooklets, which retain the larva very firmly in
  its case. As the caterpillar grows, it increases the length of its domicile from the anterior,
  causing it gradually to assume a more tubular form, tapering towards the posterior aperture, which
  is enlarged from time to time. The outside is covered with numerous fragmentary leaves and twigs
  of various sizes, placed longitudinally on the case, and, frequently, near the anterior aperture
  the materials, owing to their recent selection, are fresh and green. The interior is lined with
  soft, smooth silk of a light brown colour, the thickness of the whole fabric being about the same
  as that of an ordinary kid glove, and so strong that it is impossible to tear it, or indeed to cut
  it, except with sharp instruments. The size of the case, when the caterpillar is mature, varies
  considerably, ranging from 2¼ to 3 inches or more in length, and about ¼ inch in diameter, the
  widest portion being a little behind the anterior aperture.</p>

  <p>During the day the larva closes the entrance, and spins a loop of very strong silk <span
  class="pagenum" id="page125">{125}</span>over a twig, the ends being joined to the upper edges of
  the case on each side; in this way it hangs suspended, the caterpillar lying snugly within. I have
  often known a larva to remain thus for over three weeks without moving, and afterwards resume
  feeding as before; this probably occurs whilst the inmate is engaged in changing its skin. At
  night the larvæ may be seen busily engaged: they project the head and first four segments of the
  body beyond the case, and walk about with considerable rapidity, often lowering themselves by
  means of silken threads; the only locomotive organs are, of course, their strong thoracic legs,
  which appear to easily fulfil their double function of moving both larva and case. If disturbed,
  these insects at once retreat into their cases, closing the anterior aperture with a silken cord,
  which is kept in readiness for the purpose, and pulled from the inside by the retreating larva.
  This operation is most rapidly performed, as the upper edges of the case are flexible, and thus
  fold closely together, completely obstructing the entrance. When full grown, this caterpillar
  fastens its case to a branch with a loop of strong silk, which is drawn very tight, preventing the
  case from swinging when the plant is moved by the wind, and also rendering the insect's habitation
  more inconspicuous, by causing it to resemble a broken twig. The anterior aperture is completely
  closed, the loose edges being drawn together and fastened like a bag. The posterior end of the
  case is twisted up for some little distance above the extremity, thus completely closing the
  opening there situated. It is lined inside with a layer of very soft silk spun loosely over the
  sides, and partly filling up each end. In the centre of this the pupa lies with its head towards
  the lower portion of the case, the old larval skin being thrust backwards amongst the loose silk
  above the insect.</p>

  <p>The male and female pupæ may very easily be distinguished. The male pupa is rather attenuated,
  and has all the organs of the future moth plainly indicated on the integument, as is usual with
  lepidopterous pupæ. The female pupa, on the contrary, is merely a chain of segments, with a few
  faint indications of rudimentary organs on the anterior extremity. It is, moreover, much larger
  than the male pupa.</p>

  <p>The insect remains in this condition during the winter months. About September the male pupa
  works its way down to the lower end of the case, forces open the old aperture there situated, and
  projects the head and thorax, the pupa being secured from falling by the spines on its posterior
  segments, which retain a firm hold in the silk. Its anterior portion then breaks open, and the
  moth makes its escape, clinging to the outside of its old habitation, and drying its wings.</p>

  <p>The perfect insect must be about from September till December, but I have never then observed
  it. The only specimen I have seen was noticed flying very rapidly in the street in Wellington, in
  July. I was at first unable to tell what species it was, as it had a most unusual appearance on
  the wing, but its subsequent near approach enabled me to ascertain for certain that it was a
  specimen of this insect. In captivity I have also noticed the extreme activity of the male when
  first emerged. Indeed this moth is so vivacious, that it often happens, owing to the emergence
  usually taking place very early in the morning, that specimens are more or less injured by their
  efforts to escape, before they are discovered in the breeding cage. This restless energy of the
  male is no doubt essential to the insect's well-being, as the females, hidden away in their cases
  and incapable of any movement, must of necessity be very hard to discover. The power of locomotion
  lost in the one sex is thus doubled in the other. Considering the protection <span class="pagenum"
  id="page126">{126}</span>afforded this insect by the case, which it inhabits during its
  preparatory stages, its enormous mortality from the attacks of a parasitic dipteron (<i>Eurigaster
  marginatus</i>) is very remarkable. In this connection the following analysis of 38 cases,
  gathered at random, may be of interest<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  The method by which the <i>Pteromalus</i> introduces its eggs into the dipterous larva, which is
  in its turn enclosed in a caterpillar, is not at present known to entomologists; but it seems
  probable that the eggs of the hyper-parasite are either deposited in the eggs of the dipterous
  insect, or else on the very young larvæ, before they penetrate the skin of the caterpillar.<a

  <p>This odd-looking little insect has been found by Mr. Fereday, at Rakaia.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is hardly 1 inch. <i>All the wings are rather broad,

    hairy, and the antennæ are slightly bi-pectinated. The female is apterous.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The life-history is thus described by Mr. Fereday: "I have never seen the larva. Its case
  measures in length about 16 lines (1&#x215C; inches); the exterior is covered with pieces of stems
  of grass from a line to 5 lines in length, laid longitudinally and in the manner of thatch; the
  interior is thinly lined with fine silk. The cases are found fixed to the twigs of the Wild
  Irishman (<i>Discaria toumatou</i>), but it may be inferred from the covering of the case, that it
  probably does not feed on the shrub but upon the tussock grass, generally growing where the shrub
  is found. It is some years since I found the cases on <i>Discaria toumatou</i>, growing in the
  river-beds of the Rakaia and Waimakariri, on the Canterbury Plains, and I did not find any case in
  its earlier stage before the larva had fed up and changed into the pupa state."<a id="NtA_67"
  href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="sp5">All Mr. Fereday's specimens were bred from the cases, and to the best of my belief
  no one has ever observed the insect on the wing. It is evidently a very scarce species, and is
  probably restricted to a few river-beds in the South Island.</p>

  primeval ancestors of all the Lepidoptera, indicating their origin from the <i>Trichoptera</i> so
  nearly that one or two more discoveries might make it hard to draw any line of demarcation. The
  <i>Hepialidæ</i> are an offshoot from the <i>Micropterygidæ</i> (with considerable extinction of
  intermediate forms), constituting a separate line of development quite unconnected with any other
  <i>Lepidoptera</i>; if, as is possible, this separate stem may have ever given rise to other

  again be mentioned that the last-named family contains amongst its New Zealand representatives
  <i>Palæomicra chalcophanes</i>, a species which more closely approximates in structure to a
  Neuropterous insect than does any other member of the <i>Lepidoptera</i>. This insect is
  consequently regarded by Mr. Meyrick as the most ancient species of the order yet known. The
  survival of <i>Palæomicra</i> in New Zealand is quite in accord with the existence of such forms
  as <i>Apteryx</i> and <i>Dinornis</i> amongst the birds, the tuatara lizard (<i>Sphenodon</i>)
  amongst reptiles, and <i>Peripatus</i> amongst <i>Myriapoda</i>, archaic forms which have been
  preserved in this country through its long isolation from continental areas, and the resulting
  absence of more recent competing forms.</p>

  <p>"By no means an extensive family, yet of universal distribution. It stands more conspicuously
  isolated than any other group of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, for although it is without doubt a terminal
  development from the <i>Micropterygidæ</i> (that is one from which no existing family has
  originated), the gap between them is considerable; exotic genera, whilst differing in various
  details, are remarkably uniform in the more important peculiarities of structure, and do not at
  all tend to bridge the gap. The relatively large size of the <i>Hepialidæ</i> (of which some
  species exceed six inches in expanse of wing) may be attributed to the larval habits, which render
  these insects independent of the seasons or fluctuations of food-supply, thus removing the check
  which ordinarily limits growth. The modified type of neuration may have resulted directly from the
  increase of size, involving a great strengthening of the main veins beneath the costa to support
  the weight. As a consequence of this strengthening, the flight of the larger species is very
  powerful, and to this, combined with a choice of larval food, which is often rather
  indiscriminate, may perhaps be ascribed the wide range of the group, rather than to its antiquity.
  It is probably of Indo-Malayan origin, and must have existed in that region long enough to acquire
  fixity of type before its dispersal, which, geologically speaking, may not have been exceedingly
  remote."&mdash;(Meyrick.)</p>

  <p>This large and conspicuous insect appears to be generally distributed throughout the North
  Island.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings of the male is 4 inches, of the female sometimes fully
    5½ inches. The fore-wings of the male are <i>bright green, with a series of paler ring-shaped
    markings between the veins; an irregular row of white spots crosses the wing near the
    middle</i>, and a small white spot is situated on the costa at the base. The hind-wings are very
    pale yellowish-brown near the body, becoming pure white in the middle, and pale green on the
    termen. The head and thorax are green, the abdomen is white, tinged with green at the apex. The
    female has all the wings of a relatively more attenuated shape; <i>the fore-wings are green,
    mottled with black</i>; the hind-wings are pale reddish-brown, shaded with green near the
    termen; the abdomen is also reddish-brown, becoming green at the extremity.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The species is rather variable in both sexes. In the male the white spots on the fore-wings
  vary considerably in size, and there are occasionally several additional spots near the body. In
  the female the black markings of the fore-wings are sometimes much more extensive than the green
  ground colour. This dark form of the female was described by Butler as a distinct species, under
  the name of <i>Charagia hectori</i>. In both sexes the green colouring is occasionally entirely
  absent, a dull orange-brown taking its place. I formerly attributed this peculiarity to the
  effects of fading, but Mr. Norris has shown me a very perfect specimen of this variety, which he
  bred from the pupa, he having noticed the orange-brown colouring immediately after the insect
  emerged.</p>

  <p>The transformations of this insect are very interesting. The female lays an enormous number of
  very small, round, yellowish eggs, which she seems to deposit quite indiscriminately. The young
  larvæ consequently have to find their way along the ground to the stems of their food-plant, a
  large percentage no doubt perishing before they succeed in doing so, and this circumstance
  probably accounts for the great number of eggs produced.</p>

  <p>The food-plants of this species are numerous; the following are a few of them: "wineberry" or
  "currant" (<i>Aristotelia racemosa</i>), apparently the favourite; "manuka" (<i>Leptospermum
  ericoides</i>); "ki-ki" (<i>Astelia solandri</i>); "black maire" (<i>Olea apetela</i>); titoki
  (<i>Alectryon excelsum</i>); and <i>Melicope</i>. The larva tunnels the stems of these trees,
  feeding entirely on the wood, which it bites off with its strong mandibles.</p>

  <p>For the most part it inhabits the main stem of the tree, its gallery always having an outlet,
  which is covered with a curtain of silk and refuse, and is spun exactly level with the surrounding
  bark, and very inconspicuous. These burrows usually run towards the ground, and are mostly two or
  three inches from the surface of the trunk. In some instances the larvæ inhabit branches, in which
  case, if they are small, the tunnels are made near the centre. Later on in its life, but probably
  some time before its transformation into the pupa, the caterpillar of this insect constructs a far
  more complicated burrow than the above. It consists of a spacious, irregular, but shallow cavity,
  just under the bark, having a very large opening to the air, which is entirely covered <span
  class="pagenum" id="page130">{130}</span>with a thin silken curtain, almost exactly the same shape
  and size as the numerous marks occurring at intervals on the trunks of many of the trees. Three
  large tunnels open into this shallow cavity: one in the centre, which runs into the middle of the
  stem, and one on each side, which run right and left just under the bark. These lateral tunnels
  are usually very short, but sometimes they extend half-way round the tree, and occasionally even
  join one another on the opposite side. The central tunnel has a slightly upward direction for a
  short distance inwards, which effectually prevents it from becoming flooded in wet weather;
  afterwards it pursues an almost horizontal course until it reaches the centre of the tree, when it
  appears to suddenly terminate. This, however, is not the case, for, if the gallery floor be
  carefully examined a short distance before its apparent termination, a round trap-door will be
  found, compactly constructed of very hard, smooth silk, and corresponding with the surrounding
  portion of the tunnel so exactly that it almost escapes detection. When this lid is lifted a long,
  perpendicular shaft is disclosed, which runs down the middle of the tree to a depth of 14 or 16
  inches, and is about ½ inch in diameter. The upper end of this shaft is lined with silk, which
  forms a framework on which the trap-door rests when closed. The lid itself is of a larger size
  than the orifice which it covers, and this makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to
  force it open from the exterior, especially as it always fits down very closely as long as the
  insect remains in its burrow. The object of this contrivance is, no doubt, to prevent the ingress
  of enemies, large numbers of spiders, slugs, wood-lice, and various orthoptera being frequently
  found in both central and lateral tunnels, but they are quite unable to pass the trap-door. The
  galleries of individual larvæ are all wonderfully alike, the only differences observable being in
  the length of the perpendicular shaft, and in the direction of the horizontal burrow, which is
  sometimes curved. These variations are usually caused by the presence of other tunnels in the
  tree, which the larva appears to carefully avoid; at least I have never known an instance where a
  larva has allowed its tunnel to communicate with another one, whether inhabited or otherwise.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The caterpillar, when full grown, measures from 2½ to 3 inches in length. It is
    tolerably uniform in thickness, and of a dull yellow colour. The head is large, dark brown, very
    irregularly striated, and covered with a few short bristles. The first segment is hard and
    shining with the back and sides ruddy-brown. Its spiracle, which is very large, is situated near
    the posterior margin, and a little above it there is a dull black spot, filling a slight
    concavity about the same size as the spiracle itself. Each remaining segment has on its dorsal
    surface two horny plates, and two similar plates are situated on each side immediately below the
    spiracle. The body of the larva is thinly covered with yellow and black bristles. In many
    specimens the ventral surface and connecting membrane between the horny plates is pale purple.
    Younger specimens differ in being of an olive-green colour, which is much more pronounced, when
    they are small.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The last act performed by the caterpillar, prior to undergoing its transformation, is the
  construction of the above-described trap-door at the top of its burrow. This done the insect
  retreats to the bottom, its posterior segment resting on the termination of the vertical gallery.
  In the course of a few days the skin is cast off and worked downwards to the bottom of the burrow,
  underneath the last segment of the pupa.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">This pupa varies from 2 to 2½ inches in length. It is attenuated in form and pale
    reddish-yellow in colour. The head and dorsal portion of the thorax are dark brown and harder
    than the rest of the body. The edges of the abdominal segments are furnished dorsally with a row
    of small <span class="pagenum" id="page131">{131}</span>hooklets above and below all the
    divisions; on the ventral surface there is only a single row, which is situated in front of each
    articulation.</p>
  </div>

  <p>As development progresses in the pupa it becomes darker in colour, especially on the
  wing-cases, where, in some female specimens, the future black markings of the moth are quite
  discernible as long as two months before emergence. Other specimens remain pale in colour until
  within a fortnight or three weeks of the appearance of the imago, when the green colouring of the
  wings suddenly becomes visible through their semi-transparent envelopes.</p>

  <p>When about to emerge the pupa works its way up the vertical tunnel by means of the
  above-mentioned hooklets, forces open the trap-door, and wriggles along the horizontal burrow
  until it reaches the air, only the last three or four segments remaining in the tree. Its anterior
  portions then break open and the moth crawls out and expands its wings in the ordinary way,
  resting on the trunk of the tree, until they are of sufficient strength and hardness for
  flight.</p>

  <p>The perfect insect appears in October and November. Although it must be common, it is rarely
  seen; specimens are consequently best obtained in the pupa state and reared in captivity. The
  easiest way to find the pupa is to pass a straw into the horizontal burrow, and move it about
  until it touches the trap-door. The collector is at once apprised of this circumstance by a
  distinct hollow sound, produced by the straw when it comes in contact with the lid, which acts
  like a miniature drum. If no such sound is heard after moving the straw into every possible
  position, it may be assumed either that the insect has left the burrow, or that it is inhabited by
  a larva only. When, however, a pupa is actually discovered, a section of the tree-trunk should be
  cut out, extending from about two inches above the horizontal burrow to about one foot below it,
  and the log, thus obtained, taken home. Should a number of pupæ be found in one tree the whole
  trunk may then be taken, if practicable, and kept in a well-lighted room or a conservatory, until
  the enclosed insects emerge. The specimens usually come out of the pupa at about five or six
  o'clock in the evening, and if intended for the cabinet should be killed before dark, as they very
  soon injure themselves when flying.</p>

  <p>The best time of year to obtain the pupa of this insect is during August and September, as most
  of the specimens are then in that condition. Apart from the indications above described, burrows
  containing larvæ may often be known by the fresh pellets of excrement which are present near the
  opening. The vacated burrows frequently have the remains of the old pupa shell at the entrance,
  and generally look gnarled and weather-worn. These indications are useful as guides to the
  collector before exploring the burrow with a straw in the manner above described.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This insect is much attracted by light, and in consequence sometimes enters
  shop-windows and houses. In fact nearly all the <i>captured</i> specimens are so taken, the moth
  being very rarely found in its native forests. This circumstance is no doubt due to its very
  perfect protective colouring which, notwithstanding its large size, causes it to be almost
  invisible, when resting on the branch of a tree. On one occasion I discovered a specimen in this
  situation; being obliged to leave it for a short time, I experienced the utmost difficulty in
  finding it again, although I had taken a special note of its position. This species appears to be
  much persecuted by insectivorous birds, as we may frequently see its large green wings lying on
  the ground, where they are very conspicuous.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 5 inches. "Wings large, broad, front-wings

  <p>The type specimen of this species was unfortunately lost in the wreck of the barque 'Assaye' in

  that followed by me in all the other descriptions in this work.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The so-called "vegetable caterpillar" (infested with the <i>Sphæria</i> fungus
  [<i>Cordiceps robertsii</i>]) is, I think, very probably the larva of this insect. It was formerly
  supposed to be the larva of <i>Hepialus virescens</i>; but I have pointed out elsewhere<a
  id="NtA_68" href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> that this is certainly erroneous, the larva of <i>H.

  whilst the "vegetable" larva is subterranean. The real point to be discovered is the precise
  species of <i>Lepidoptera</i> this caterpillar would develop into, if not attacked by the fungus;
  but at present no definite information has been obtained on the subject.</p>

  <p>This insect is fairly common, and generally distributed throughout the country. It is very
  abundant in the Manawatu district.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. The fore-wings vary from
    brownish-black to dull yellow; there are several small white spots near the base margined with
    black, and an obscure cloudy central streak, sometimes containing one or two minute irregular
    white marks; near the termen a broad, pale, wavy line runs from the costa to the dorsum, and
    contains several elongate dull white spots, margined with black; another series of smaller spots
    is often situated between this line and the termen; there is a terminal row of small black
    spots. The <span class="pagenum" id="page134">{134}</span>hind-wings vary from pale
    greyish-brown to dull yellow. The cilia of all the wings are barred with dark brown.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This species is extremely variable. In many cases a large number of the spots is wanting. Mr.
  Meyrick states that the northern specimens are more yellow-ochreous, and more distinctly spotted
  than the southern ones. He adds that "the ochreous forms are easily distinguished from other
  species by the numerous spots and the absence of a continuous pale discal streak; the fuscous
  forms are sometimes very similar in colouring to <i>P. despecta</i>, but they are distinctly
  shorter-winged, and the compound discal spots appear to be a good character."</p>

  <p>I have taken several specimens of what appears to be a variety of this species on the Tableland
  of Mount Arthur. It is much paler than the typical form, the markings much less distinct, and the
  central portions of the fore-wings very pale yellow (see fig. 18).</p>

    in the middle of the wing</i>; there are also many irregular markings with dull white centres,
    chiefly situated near the veins, and often arranged in two or three rows parallel to the termen.
    All the markings are very variable, but the insect may be at once known by the irregular central
    white stripe. When alive the entire colouring is always strongly tinged with pink.</p>

  <p>I have often found a large subterranean caterpillar, that I believe to be the larva of this
  insect; but as I have never succeeded in rearing a specimen, I cannot assign it to this species
  with absolute certainty.</p>

  <div class="smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0">The length of this larva when full grown is nearly 3 inches. Its colour is dirty
    white, becoming darker on the back. The head is dark brown, very rough and horny; the three
    first segments are also horny on the dorsal surface. The rest of the body is very much softer,
    and is furnished with several horny tubercles, each of which emits a long bristle.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This larva is very lively when disturbed. It usually disgorges a large quantity of black juice
  from the mouth, biting meantime, in order no doubt to frighten its enemies. It feeds on the roots
  of various grasses.</p>

    <p>This organ is termed the tongue by Mr. Meyrick. As many mandibulate insects possess a true
    tongue, and the proboscis of the <i>Lepidoptera</i> is not homologous with the tongue, but with
    the maxillæ, I think the term is very misleading.</p>

    <p><i>Leucania aulacias</i>, Meyr., is distinguished by having grey cilia to the hind-wings. The
    species was described from a single specimen taken at Dunedin and now in Mr. Fereday's
    collection. I have carefully examined this specimen, and find that the cilia, although
    considerably injured, are distinctly grey. As, however, I think it undesirable to characterize
    species so closely resembling each other from such meagre material, I here regard it as a
    synonym of <i>Leucania arotis</i>.</p>

    <p>In connection with these three species of <i>Notoreas</i> I should here mention that I have a
    number of specimens in my collection which appear to me to establish a complete transition
    between <i>N. mechanitis</i>, <i>N. paradelpha</i>, and <i>N. perornata</i>. From a careful
    study of these specimens I am led to believe that these three forms are really only varieties of
    one very variable species. Mr. Meyrick does not at present share this opinion, but I am disposed
    to think that this is chiefly due to the comparatively limited number of specimens he has had
    the opportunity of examining. In any case I do not regard the question of the specific or
    varietal values of these, or indeed of any other forms, as matters of great scientific
    importance, being, to a great extent, merely matters of individual opinion.</p>

    <p>Since writing the above, I have been informed by Mr. Kingsley that one male specimen of <i>A.
    bolina</i> was taken at Wakapuaka, in 1896, and two others reported as seen at Collingwood and
    Nelson in March, 1897. Mr. A. P. Buller has also kindly informed me of the capture of a male
    specimen in perfect condition, at Ohau, Manawatu district, in March, 1898.</p>

    of this species in forest on the Dun Mountain, Nelson, at an elevation of about 2,000 feet.</p>
